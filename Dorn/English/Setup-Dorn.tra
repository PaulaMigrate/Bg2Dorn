@0   = ~Dorn expanded romance by trinit~
@1   = ~To this day, tales of Dorn Il-Khan and <CHARNAME> are told, both by parents whose unruly children need some discipline and those vile men and women who admired the malevolent pair's deeds and the way they complemented each-other. Their relationship was a tempestuous one but their bond was as strong as ever. The following years consisted mostly of adventure and travels with a few unsucessful attempts to form a small kingdom for themselves. Unsurprisingly, with time they found it increasingly difficult to tolerate civilisation and rules as others defined them. After some time, they simply vanished with no trace. Few reports claim they were sighted at the Spine of the World, and rumors have it they formed a reclusive base there, far from civilisation, free to do and operate as they see fit. Their final fate remains unclear and some claim they turned their gaze to other planes, while others say they search for a way to ascend to godhood as a pair. Still, one thing is certain: <CHARNAME>'s and Dorn's twisted union became a dark legend and the planes are bound to feel it's consequences in the times to come.~
@2   = ~After the initial exhilaration has settled, Dorn started to realize <CHARNAME>'s ascension hit him harder than expected, since he found himself missing the presence of his mate. Still, true to his word, he became a devout worshipper of the new deity. His charisma, legendary status and newfound focus helped rapidly spread the faith, inspiring fear and obedience whenever he went in his many travels. Power was always abundant in <CHARNAME>'s wake and as the favored of the <CHARNAME>'s flock, Dorn managed to gain something else, a measure of satisfaction and resolution in service to his beloved deity. Still, even though he managed to avoid divine wrath and many years passed, mortal justice would eventually find him. Hunted down and captured by a "Freelance Jurist", Mercy Whitedove, he was taken back to Luskan to stand trial. Sentenced to death for his crimes, Dorn broke free of the prison on three occasions before the sentence could be carried out. Twice, he was tracked down by Whitedove and returned. For their final meeting, Dorn was determined not to be taken alive, and in this respect he was successful. Whitedove and Dorn were both slain that day and it is said that at the moment of Dorn's death, <CHARNAME>'s symbol could be seen shining brightly in the sky. It is said that since that day, god <CHARNAME> gained a proxy that took on a form of a loyal, dark half-orc. At the end, Dorn's deeds and twisted love granted him place at <CHARNAME>'s side, forever remaining there as a devoted consort and an extension of his deity's will.~
