@1   = ~A principle for fools and weaklings looking for excuses not to do as they will. Why are you wasting time with this monk, <CHARNAME>?~
@2   = ~I have no idea, but I shall waste no more.~
@3   = ~His tale interests me, Dorn. Be silent, or leave us. Go on, Rasaad. You were telling of your recent ventures.~
@4   = ~Looks like the killers missed a few.~
@5   = ~But fine sport he'd make.~
@6   = ~Bollard Firejaw! Come and meet your doom!~ [OH74795]
@7   = ~Your feelings on the matter are of no consequence. All that matters is that you die in the name of my master, Ur-Gothoz!~ [OH74797]
@8   = ~Kill them all! None must live to tell of our deeds.~ [OH74802]
@9   = ~I would never betray Ur-Gothoz. I let Azothet believe I would to discover her scheme.~ [OH75392]
@10  = ~All I ask is that I be allowed to view the malevolent snake when you do.~ [OH75394]
@11  = ~I would never betray you, Ur-Gothoz. I will never relinquish my grasp on the power you supply. I let Azothet believe I would to discover her scheme.~ [OH75436]
@12  = ~I tell you I am a loyal servant, and I've the blood on my hands to prove it. I've half-filled a Hell at your command. Watch your foes continue to fall beneath my blade or end me now. The choice is yours.~ [OH75438]
@13  = ~Silence, demon!~ [OH77311]
@14  = ~It's yours no longer, glabrezu!~ [OH77317]
@15  = ~Someday, perhaps. But not today.~ [OH77319]
@16  = ~What nonsense is this? I'll hear no more of it!~
@17  = ~Insight? From you? I care naught for your insight, woman. Play your mind games with someone else!~
@18  = ~You should have gone out of your way to hide, vampire. You'll regret your carelessness by the time I'm done with you.~
@19  = ~What infernal land have you dragged me to now, <CHARNAME>? Tell me what new creatures will fall before us!~
@20  = ~Finding Irenicus in Hell

Irenicus's death did not have the same effect as Bodhi's did, and my soul has not returned to me. Perhaps it was because of the power he gathered from the Tree of Life, or because Bodhi was undead. Regardless, Irenicus has fallen, dragging both my soul and me inexorably behind. And such was the power that my party members that had fallen or were near death were drawn with us as well! Together we are in Hell, and I am certain Irenicus is somewhere near. Somehow, through all this, I feel I must find him and battle him once and for all to get my soul back.~
@21  = ~Pretty words, mage. But pretty words will not save you from my wrath!~
@22  = ~I pick my own fights, <PRO_RACE>. And I choose this one.~
@23  = ~No challenge is insurmountable to Dorn Il-Khan!~
@24  = ~Oh, shut up, <CHARNAME>. Haven't you paid attention to anything I was saying? I will not abandon you.~
@25  = ~Besides, neither you nor I will be satisfied with this husk of a <PRO_MANWOMAN> standing before me.~
@26  = ~Let's go make you complete once more.~
@27  = ~I would see him live again a thousand times that I might slay him a thousand times more—but a single death with suffice for our purposes. You are victorious, <CHARNAME>!~
@28  = ~What's the problem, <CHARNAME>?~
@29  = ~No problem, Dorn. Why do you ask?~
@30  = ~I'm not sure. For a moment there, it felt like—I wasn't myself. Like I was losing control...~
@31  = ~My problem is with half-orcs poking their tusks into my business.~
@32  = ~You faltered there a moment. It was subtle, but noticeable.~
@33  = ~You see issues where none exist, Dorn. Let's carry on.~
@34  = ~I felt, for a second, like I was—was losing control...~
@35  = ~You see what you want to see, half-orc. You are a predator, looking for weakness—I have none.~
@36  = ~If that's your only problem, then we've no problem at all.~
@37  = ~Hmm. As you wish.~
@38  = ~A troubling notion. Focus yourself, <PRO_MANWOMAN>. The last thing we need now is you getting distracted.~
@39  = ~Hah! The avatar of Bhaal stands revealed at last! You are the Slayer, <CHARNAME>!~
@40  = ~I never knew you had it in you!~
@41  = ~You tremble like a child, <CHARNAME>. What's the problem now?~
@42  = ~Get away from me, Dorn. I don't know what's happening.~
@43  = ~Where do I begin, you bloody great oaf? Oh, I know—I'M LOSING CONTROL!~
@44  = ~No problem at all, unless you get in my way.~
@45  = ~What? Your lips move, but nothing comes out. Speak up, <PRO_MANWOMAN>!~
@46  = ~Such power...! You are magnificent, <CHARNAME>!~
@47  = ~I'd feel more magnificent if I could control the transformation.~
@48  = ~You need to leave, Dorn. You aren't safe around me.~
@49  = ~I turned into a bloody monster and you call that magnificent?~
@50  = ~The power of the gods cannot be controlled—it can only be savored. I advise you to do so as often as possible.~
@51  = ~When has it ever been safe to walk beside the Bhaalspawn? No, I'll not leave you, especially not now that I've seen the true extent of your power. Forward!~
@52  = ~What else could I call such a display of raw divine might?~
@53  = ~I'll not bow to you or any worldly entity, vampire.~ [OH95204]
@54  = ~You will feel my strength now. I'll show you a darkness you never imagined!~ [OH95202]
@55  = ~My patron grants me more power than you ever could, vampire. And I doubt he'll let me bow to another.~ [OH95198]
@56  = ~You should have listened to me, vampire. Now I'll show you a darkness you never imagined!~ [OH95201]
@57  = ~The great elven city of Suldanessellar, brought to its knees by a single mage. Pathetic.~
@58  = ~Hah! You dragons are all the same. All sound and fury, creatures of pure bluster! Come and fight us, you great coward!~
@59  = ~I will treasure this moment, gnome. You are exactly where you belong.~
@60  = ~We slaughtered your miserable hide last time, ogre. I will take great joy in doing so again!~
@61  = ~And you take pride in your survival? Wretch! Better to die on your feet than live on your knees.~
@62  = ~It is good to be traveling with you once more, <CHARNAME>. ~
@63  = ~We are a formidable pair, you and I. ~
@64  = ~We are indeed. ~
@65  = ~Part of an excellent team.~
@66  = ~Let me make this clear: We are not a pair. ~
@67  = ~I see you still have other... companions. ~
@68  = ~One can never have too many friends.~
@69  = ~For the time being, yes.~
@70  = ~You have a problem with that?~
@71  = ~Yes...~
@72  = ~We battle together, we eat together, we defend one another. Like it or not, we ARE a pair.~
@73  = ~You must know they will aid you only while it is convenient. You can trust no one but yourself.~
@74  = ~My enemies are too numerous and too powerful to face alone.~
@75  = ~You misunderstand. They are here only while it is convenient for ME. The moment their usefulness ends, so will they.~
@76  = ~Yourself included?~
@77  = ~Your enemies may walk beside you without you knowing.~
@78  = ~What happened to you was regrettable, but it will not happen to me.~
@79  = ~I'm well aware of that. You're one of the ones who walk beside me, after all.~
@80  = ~Enemies or not, I have need of their skills. ~
@81  = ~Fine: Trust them and bear the consequences. They will cut your legs from under you, and I will laugh as they do so.~
@82  = ~They will not betray me, Dorn.~
@83  = ~And I will laugh as they prove you wrong time and time again.~
@84  = ~We will see who laughs last, Dorn.~
@85  = ~We will indeed.~
@86  = ~Trust is for children and old women. Those with power have no need of it. ~
@87  = ~Need it? No. But I choose to have it, all the same.~
@88  = ~You didn't have many friends as a child, did you?~
@89  = ~Keep talking and you'll see my power firsthand, half-orc.~
@90  = ~A tempting offer. Or did you mean it as a threat?~
@91  = ~You can't tell...? Your loss, half-orc.~
@92  = ~When—IF I make you an offer, you'll know it.~
@93  = ~It was definitely a threat.~
@94  = ~So it was a threat.~
@95  = ~Enjoy your childhood while it lasts.~
@96  = ~No.~
@97  = ~I am glad to hear it. But watch them carefully. If you see so much as a hint of weakness or insubordination, destroy them before they destroy you.~
@98  = ~Hah! No, you may trust me. Our goals align, and our relationship is one of mutual benefit. I will not betray you so long as you do not betray me.~
@99  = ~Peace, <CHARNAME>. I was simply making conversation. I'd not see you die this <DAYNIGHTALL>.~
@100 = ~Nor I you.~
@101 = ~My death isn't the one you should be worried about.~
@102 = ~Enough words. When you are ready to do more than talk, you know where to find me.~
@103 = ~You have grown claws since we parted. Mind that those claws stay sheathed lest I am forced to remove them.~
@104 = ~When I joined you, I believed our goals were more closely aligned. I see now I was wrong. Your knees are so weak it's a wonder you don't lie face-down in the dirt.~
@105 = ~Choosing a path other than violence is no weakness, Dorn.~
@106 = ~Shall I show you just how "weak" I am, half-orc? Has the time come?~
@107 = ~Explain yourself, Dorn. For your sake, I hope the explanation is a good one.~
@108 = ~Your lack of ambition disgusts me. I should kill you where you stand and feed your soul to Ur-Gothoz.~
@109 = ~Don't threaten me, half-orc. You won't like where that leads.~
@110 = ~You don't like the way I handle things, Dorn? What would you have me do differently?~
@111 = ~You should try. No, seriously. Try to kill me where I stand. See where it leads.~
@112 = ~I tell you this, <CHARNAME>. My blade thirsts for blood, and soon. You had best act quickly to ensure it doesn't drink yours.~
@113 = ~I will rip you limb from limb!~
@114 = ~It is good to be traveling with one who knows <PRO_HISHER> bloody path, <CHARNAME>. My patron is pleased.~
@115 = ~Likewise. Ours will be a fruitful alliance, I suspect.~
@116 = ~I'm glad to hear it. Your patron's desires are my paramount concern.~
@117 = ~So he should be. You have proved your value many times over, to him and me alike.~
@118 = ~I am glad to hear it.~
@119 = ~Yes, I believe it will. ~
@120 = ~Would that these others you surround yourself with could say the same. I am concerned with these others, however. Are you sure you can trust them?~
@121 = ~With my life.~
@122 = ~Who are you to question those I trust?~
@123 = ~Trust them? No. But I need them, for now.~
@124 = ~Then you are a fool.~
@125 = ~Someone who's known betrayal.~
@126 = ~Watch them carefully, <CHARNAME>. And when they are no longer of use, send them on their way, or better still, destroy them.~
@127 = ~Is that how you'd have me treat you?~
@128 = ~Do me a favor, Dorn. When I'm no longer of use to you, just cast me aside. I'd rather not fight you over it.~
@129 = ~And if I said you were no longer of use?~
@130 = ~Of course! But then, I know my own value. You will always find me of use.~
@131 = ~You think highly of yourself, half-orc. Too highly.~
@132 = ~I hope you're right, for your sake.~
@133 = ~Keep thinking that way, Dorn. It'll make my life much easier.~
@134 = ~You are wise, <CHARNAME>. But I'll make you no promises.~
@135 = ~Then strike me down—if you can.~
@136 = ~But you won't. You won't even try. You would be a fool to cast me aside, and you are no fool.~
@137 = ~But if the day comes that you would turn on me... woe be unto you, <CHARNAME>. That day will be your last.~
@138 = ~We make a good team, you and I. ~
@139 = ~We do indeed. ~
@140 = ~A good team of bad, bad people.~
@141 = ~The one who does the least work usually thinks so.~
@142 = ~Is that wit you're attempting, <CHARNAME>?~
@143 = ~Because you shouldn't.~
@144 = ~This mage you chase. How did he earn your ire? ~
@145 = ~He tortured and experimented on Imoen and me. He will pay for our pain a thousand times over with his own.~
@146 = ~He did things to me no person should do to another.~
@147 = ~I'd rather not speak of it.~
@148 = ~How did you allow this to happen?~
@149 = ~Some fights cannot be won.~
@150 = ~Well, you know my love of cages and chains...~
@151 = ~I don't want to talk about it.~
@152 = ~No, please. Tell me of this mage who single-handedly overcame, captured, and tortured you.~
@153 = ~He didn't do it single-handedly.~
@154 = ~What part of "I'd rather not speak of it" do you not understand?~
@155 = ~Shut your mouth lest you feel some of what I did firsthand.~
@156 = ~So this wizard and his minions overcame you.~
@157 = ~Yes they did. Kind of like your companions and Simmeon overcame you.~
@158 = ~Looking to compare notes, Dorn? After all, you have some experience in that area.~
@159 = ~To remind you, Dorn: like you, I didn't go down without a fight.~
@160 = ~Funny. I'm sure your captor was suitably entertained.~
@161 = ~I would be embarrassed too.~
@162 = ~Sulking is how you deal with harsh words? If I recall correctly, I was betrayed, not ambushed, <PRO_RACE>. There is a difference.~
@163 = ~In any case, nobody is completely immune to surprises.~
@164 = ~Be that as it may, how do you feel now about this whole Simmeon bussiness?~
@165 = ~Whatever stokes your ego,<PRO_RACE>.~
@166 = ~Enough. Let's just keep to the road.~
@167 = ~I had my vengeance and my former companions are dust in the wind, of no further concern to me.~
@168 = ~All the same, <CHARNAME>, I learned form it. One has to be prepared, self-sufficient and exact proper vengeance for transgressions.~
@169 = ~Remember, as the stakes will grow ever higher, mistakes will also grow increasingly lethal.~
@170 = ~Ah! This endless walking makes me restless.~
@171 = ~You think I like it any better?~
@172 = ~Funny. It usually tires me out.~
@173 = ~Your whining won't make it go any faster.~
@174 = ~I've an idea. You and I will spar. To the victor, the glory! ~
@175 = ~Excellent idea! I could use an easy win. ~
@176 = ~Very well.~
@177 = ~Let's finish walking first.~
@178 = ~Ah... oh no, my leg really hurts. I'm going to have to pass.~
@179 = ~Then you're about to be disappointed.~
@180 = ~Irenicus's dungeon has left you weak, is that it? Or do you fear the might of the great Dorn Il-Khan?~
@181 = ~I'll not be goaded into a pointless battle.~
@182 = ~Whatever will shut you up, that's why I don't want to beat the living hells out of you. Let's keep moving.~
@183 = ~I'll show you how much I fear you, half-orc.~
@184 = ~No weapons, no armor, no magic. A true match of prowess. ~
@185 = ~Bah. You're an old <PRO_MANWOMAN>, <CHARNAME>. ~
@186 = ~Prepare yourself!~
@187 = ~Hmm. You are more skilled in the art of battle than I'd thought.~
@188 = ~Let this be a lesson to you. Never underestimate your opponent.~
@189 = ~You're a formidable opponent, Dorn.~
@190 = ~No surprise there. Thinking isn't your strong suit.~
@191 = ~Your form is poor, and you hold back when you should strike. You have much to learn, <CHARNAME>.~
@192 = ~You'll find me a fast learner.~
@193 = ~Good gods. I think I need some healing.~
@194 = ~Things will go differently the next time you face me.~
@195 = ~After the beating you just took? Yes, I'd imagine so.~
@196 = ~I look forward to it.~
@197 = ~Yes, I am. And it takes a formidable warrior to match my strength. ~
@198 = ~You are an attractive <PRO_MANWOMAN>, <CHARNAME>. ~
@199 = ~Ah. I think you may have the wrong idea, Dorn. I'm not interested in you.~
@200 = ~I must admit, you have a rugged... tusked allure yourself.~
@201 = ~You're very observant.~
@202 = ~Good to see you have a taste for lust. I can work with that.~
@203 = ~Next time, perhaps the sparring will be a little more intimate.~
@204 = ~I'd like that.~
@205 = ~In your dreams, half-orc. It certainly won't happen in this world.~
@206 = ~Don't count on it.~
@207 = ~A shame. You'd have enjoyed it.~
@208 = ~You feel it as strongly as I, do you not? ~
@209 = ~Uh... maybe? What are you talking about?~
@210 = ~If you're thinking what I'm thinking, then most definitely.~
@211 = ~We don't have time for this, Dorn.~
@212 = ~I can see the hunger in your eyes.~
@213 = ~I can wait no longer. I would have you as mine, <CHARNAME>. ~
@214 = ~I'm sorry?~
@215 = ~My, you are very eager, aren't you?~
@216 = ~You will wait as long as I desire.~
@217 = ~You think I serve your will, <PRO_RACE>?~
@218 = ~Such strength—such power! You are everything I've ever wanted, <CHARNAME>!~
@219 = ~I will give you pleasure as none have before. ~
@220 = ~You're going to have to work harder than that.~
@221 = ~I'll hold you to that.~
@222 = ~You presume too much.~
@223 = ~Let her speak for herself. What say you, <CHARNAME>? You want this as much as I, admit it.~
@224 = ~I do want it. But you'll have to work harder than that.~
@225 = ~It's true. Gods help me.~
@226 = ~I'm not sure about that. You seem to want it very, very badly.~
@227 = ~I admit nothing of the sort.~
@228 = ~Let him speak for himself. What say you, <CHARNAME>? You want this as much as I, admit it.~
@229 = ~I do. Gods help me.~
@230 = ~I'll not be coerced into making a decision before I'm ready.~
@231 = ~You want this as much as I.~
@232 = ~So you want to believe.~
@233 = ~And you do not?~
@234 = ~Oh, I do. You have no idea.~
@235 = ~I haven't decided yet.~
@236 = ~With you? No. No, I don't.~
@237 = ~What? You would spurn Dorn Il-Khan?~
@238 = ~I'm not spurning anyone yet. I just need more time.~
@239 = ~Patience, Dorn.~
@240 = ~Yes. Enthusiastically.~
@241 = ~Make up your mind, <CHARNAME>. I'll not be a slave to your whims.~
@242 = ~You've made a grave error, <CHARNAME>. And by the time you realize that, it will be too late.~
@243 = ~Yes... it will. ~
@244 = ~This will be a night to remember... I assure you.~
@245 = ~You intrigue me, <CHARNAME>. I've waited a long time to find one such as you. You remind me of my father sometimes.~ [OH96303]
@246 = ~Patience is rewarded.~
@247 = ~And I've waited a long time for such as you.~
@248 = ~I remind you of your father?~
@249 = ~I remind you of your mother?~
@250 = ~Wait longer, half-orc.~
@251 = ~My mother? She was a formidable woman.~ [OH96308]
@252 = ~You want to talk to me about your mother?~
@253 = ~He was a fearsome warrior. You share some of the traits with him.~
@254 = ~You want to talk to me about your father?~
@255 = ~You compare me to your father. That is... a little creepy.~
@256 = ~He'd have had to be, I think.~
@257 = ~You reject me?~ [OH96312]
@258 = ~I can't give you what you want, Dorn. I'm sorry.~
@259 = ~We've more important things to attend to. What you suggest would do nothing but distract us from our goals.~
@260 = ~Yes. Best you know where you stand now than make a fool of yourself later.~
@261 = ~I'd not be a fool for you, or anyone.~ [OH96316]
@262 = ~I don't want to discuss my mother!~ [OH96318]
@263 = ~Then what would you discuss?~
@264 = ~Hey, you're the one who compared me to her.~
@265 = ~You think I do?~
@266 = ~I don't want to discuss my father!~
@267 = ~Hey, you're the one who compared me to him.~
@268 = ~ 'Twas intended as a compliment.~ [OH96322]
@269 = ~I was joking, Dorn. If we're going to do this, you'll need to work on your sense of humor.~
@270 = ~Your flattery skills will need some work if we're to proceed down this path.~
@271 = ~Intentions are irrelevant. It's actions that count.~
@272 = ~So you would proceed down this path?~ [OH96326]
@273 = ~For a time, at least.~
@274 = ~I've wanted to ever since I first laid eyes on you.~
@275 = ~You're a bloodthirsty half-orc whose heart and soul are shrouded in darkness. We're perfect for each other.~
@276 = ~I would, but not with you.~
@277 = ~This is no laughing matter, <CHARNAME>.~ [OH96330]
@278 = ~Can you never see the lighter side of things?~
@279 = ~I wasn't joking. We are perfect for one another.~
@280 = ~And that's why we can never be more than professional colleagues.~
@281 = ~Me and you, romantically involved? You're wrong, Dorn—that is hilarious.~
@282 = ~What the future holds—for us.~ [OH96334]
@283 = ~Much the same as the past, I suspect. You would have more?~
@284 = ~Let's live in the present and see where that takes us, all right?~
@285 = ~We have no future, Dorn. Our fates seem to be entwined—but that is all that will be entwined.~
@286 = ~Not of this.~ [OH96338]
@287 = ~A pity. If you were willing to bend just a little, we might have had something great.~
@288 = ~Fair enough. I can understand that.~
@289 = ~We are very different people, Dorn.~
@290 = ~Then we've nothing more to discuss.~
@291 = ~I don't bend, for you or anyone.~ [OH96342]
@292 = ~Those who don't bend will break.~
@293 = ~I would have bent for you.~
@294 = ~And that is why this can never happen.~
@295 = ~The weak break. The strong stand triumphant over all that would see them broken—or bent.~ [OH96346]
@296 = ~Perhaps you will yet.~ [OH96347]
@297 = ~Perhaps.~
@298 = ~Oh, I'm certain I will—just not for you.~
@299 = ~You'll never know.~
@300 = ~But a pleasurable distraction it would be.~ [OH96351]
@301 = ~It would be that. I'll consider the matter.~
@302 = ~We're too different, Dorn. And I doubt either of us is prepared to compromise much.~
@303 = ~Aye, it would—but you'll never know.~
@304 = ~I don't bend, for you or anyone.~ [OH96355]
@305 = ~We shall see, <CHARNAME>. I enjoy a challenge.~ [OH96357]
@306 = ~We'll see how much you enjoy it in the end.~
@307 = ~I'll enjoy watching you take this one.~
@308 = ~A challenge implies the possibility of success. You have no chance, Dorn. Whatever delusion has taken hold of your deranged mind, give it up now.~
@309 = ~You will look back on this and regret your words, <CHARNAME>. You can be sure of it.~ [OH96361]
@310 = ~Don't apologize, <CHARNAME>. It is a hallmark of the weak. You have made your feelings clear. I respect that.~ [OH96362]
@311 = ~I could not agree more.~ [OH96363]
@312 = ~I look forward to seeing what you do next.~
@313 = ~So what will you do now?~
@314 = ~Then let us speak no more about this and end it.~
@315 = ~You'll like it, I assure you.~ [OH96367]
@316 = ~I hope you're right, Dorn—for your sake.~
@317 = ~That remains to be seen.~
@318 = ~We'll see. I am not easily impressed.~
@319 = ~I've not decided yet.~ [OH96371]
@320 = ~Good. I enjoy a challenge.~ [OH96372]
@321 = ~I would.~ [OH96373]
@322 = ~Show me. Actions speak louder than words.~
@323 = ~Then get ready for disappointment.~
@324 = ~I wish you luck. You'll need it.~
@325 = ~Too different?~ [OH96377]
@326 = ~Unless we're both willing to compromise a bit, I fear so.~
@327 = ~I'm not sure yet. What do you intend to do about it?~
@328 = ~For what we're discussing? Yes.~
@329 = ~I'm just getting started.~ [OH96381]
@330 = ~See that you do.~ [OH96382]
@331 = ~Nonetheless, I look forward to where this might lead.~
@332 = ~Good. I look forward to where this might lead.~
@333 = ~Your constant supervision tires me, Bhaalspawn.~
@334 = ~This again?~
@335 = ~Can I help you, Dorn?~
@336 = ~I don't "supervise." I lead.~
@337 = ~I warned you already. Your leadership is laughable and your course folly. I refuse to bow down any longer!~
@338 = ~As ever, you are free to do as you want. I wouldn't dream of trying to stop you.~
@339 = ~Will you tell already what this is really about? ~
@340 = ~Are you looking for a fight? Because that's what you're going to get if you don't shut the hells up!~
@341 = ~Do not lie to me, <CHARNAME>. ~
@342 = ~My patron demands blood and death! You give me naught but skirmishes and petty arguments!~
@343 = ~I feel your frustration. There will be bloodshed, Dorn, but now is not the time. ~
@344 = ~Well, we can't go around killing every damned Jack and Sally the world has ever known! ~
@345 = ~If blood is what you want, Dorn, I can show you your own!~
@346 = ~Then when? Tomorrow? Next week? No! Ur-Gothoz demands death, and he shall have it!~
@347 = ~Then set sights higher! We are a force to be reckoned with, a power matched by few. ~
@348 = ~Try it, Bhaalspawn! You'll rue the day you laid eyes on me!~
@349 = ~From now on, we do things my way.~
@350 = ~You think you can do a better job than I?~
@351 = ~You WILL do as I say, half-orc. Do you understand?~
@352 = ~Fine, then leave. I have no use for whining children.~
@353 = ~A dumb, deaf halfwit could do a better job than you.~
@354 = ~I will not! ~
@355 = ~If I cannot have my freedom, I will at least unleash my wrath as I please!~
@356 = ~You know this isn't about me at all!~
@357 = ~You chose to join me of your own volition, Dorn. You are free to do as you please.~
@358 = ~You will do as I say or you will leave! Now!~
@359 = ~You want to fight? Fine! I'll give you a fight!~
@360 = ~I'll show you the whining child here!~
@361 = ~This is—~
@362 = ~I know my own mind! ~
@363 = ~You regret your oath to Ur-Gothoz. You tire of following his orders, not mine.~
@364 = ~Fine, then. If this is about me, why now? Why not a week ago? I'm no fool, and neither are you.~
@365 = ~No more words! I will have blood!~
@366 = ~Then I am free to do this! ~
@367 = ~You will die first!~
@368 = ~ENOUGH! Enough. ~
@369 = ~I will listen. For now. But if you do not afford me the respect I am due, <PRO_RACE>, I will have your head.~
@370 = ~Your father was the Lord of Murder, was he not?~
@371 = ~Bhaal was the god of murder, yes.~
@372 = ~Yes. Family reunions were bleak affairs.~
@373 = ~What of it?~
@374 = ~How do you intend to carry out his legacy? ~
@375 = ~Carry out his— Are you insane? Why would I want to do that?~
@376 = ~By doing exactly what I'm doing.~
@377 = ~*I* am his legacy, and I will do what I please. ~
@378 = ~Bhaal was a powerful god. You would be a fool not to embrace his power as your own.~
@379 = ~Do not worry. I intend to do exactly that.~
@380 = ~And what if I'm content without the power of a deranged god?~
@381 = ~Power has a price. I don't know if I'm prepared to pay it.~
@382 = ~I approve.~
@383 = ~Many would kill for a taste of the power that is your birthright. Remember that.~
@384 = ~Then you are a foolish <PRO_RACE>.~
@385 = ~Wise outlook. On the other hand, nothing is free of cost.~
@386 = ~"<CHARNAME>, Scourge of the Sword Coast." Word of your passage has reached Amn. Your reputation is growing.~
@387 = ~Are they really calling me that?~
@388 = ~Oh, gods. That is not a title to pull out in mixed company.~
@389 = ~Soon it will be more than just reputation to the idiots here in Amn.~
@390 = ~Do you not hear it as we walk the streets? Do you not see the looks given you by the peasantry and nobility alike?~
@391 = ~Indeed.~
@392 = ~Your infamy may someday rival my own. ~
@393 = ~Somehow, I doubt it.~
@394 = ~The idea fills my heart with joy. No, wait. Not joy. The opposite of that.~
@395 = ~Yes. Someday soon.~
@396 = ~As do I. But stranger things have happened.~
@397 = ~Tell me, Bhaalspawn. When you enter into the fray, stare your enemy in the eye, and attack, what is it you feel?~
@398 = ~Fury. Heat. Bloodlust. ~
@399 = ~Relaxed. I just let it happen.~
@400 = ~Unreasoning panic, usually. I'm amazed I've made it this far.~
@401 = ~A <PRO_MANWOMAN> after my own heart.~
@402 = ~A warrior born, without fear or hesitation. Interesting.~
@403 = ~I have seen the wide-eyed fear, but also the set of your jaw. You have determination, if nothing else.~
@404 = ~There is more to you than meets the eye. ~
@405 = ~But a fair amount of me that meets the eye too, right?~
@406 = ~A <PRO_MANWOMAN> has to have <PRO_HISHER> secrets, Dorn.~
@407 = ~I think you have hidden depths as well. You let it slip sometimes.~
@408 = ~There is. Some parts more pleasing than others.~
@409 = ~Yes. I suppose you do. ~
@410 = ~Perhaps, <CHARNAME>. Be grateful you can say that about me, not many people do.~
@411 = ~I have cast off my chains and am free to do as I will, thanks to you.~
@412 = ~Please. You freed yourself. I'll take neither the credit nor the blame.~
@413 = ~You're welcome, Dorn. And what is it you will?~
@414 = ~Now you must do something for me.~
@415 = ~For now, I will follow your lead. Doing so has served me well so far. However, there is something I'd ask of you first.~
@416 = ~As you wish. For now, I will follow your lead. However, there is something I'd ask of you first.~
@417 = ~Wait, I have something to say.~
@418 = ~You are a powerful <PRO_MANWOMAN>, <CHARNAME>. Your talents are many and you hold your own in battle, striking fear into the hearts of your enemies. ~
@419 = ~I have never known another like you.~
@420 = ~My blood boils to look at you, god-child, and I can wait no longer. ~
@421 = ~Will you share my bedroll tonight? I assure you... you will not regret it. ~
@422 = ~And what of tomorrow? The nights are cold, Dorn. I would have a companion, not a distraction.~
@423 = ~You've got that right.~
@424 = ~I'm sorry, Dorn. I can't.~
@425 = ~And tomorrow, and the nights after, if that is what you wish. ~
@426 = ~It is, and has been for a long time now.~
@427 = ~I will have you, Dorn Il-Khan.~
@428 = ~That's just it. I don't think it is. I'm sorry.~
@429 = ~I look forward to it. ~
@430 = ~Bah! I was wrong about you. You are no better than all the rest.~
@431 = ~And mine as well. ~
@432 = ~And I you.~
@433 = ~<CHARNAME> and Dorn... I like the sound of that.~
@434 = ~Share my bedroll once more. You know you will not regret it.~
@435 = ~You're right about that.~
@436 = ~Power such as I have never known flows through my veins... and I have you to thank for it.~
@437 = ~Please. You did this yourself. I'll take neither the credit nor the blame.~
@438 = ~How fare you, <CHARNAME>? ~
@439 = ~As though you care.~
@440 = ~I'm fine. Just... fine.~
@441 = ~I've lost my soul. How do you think I fare?~
@442 = ~You know me well enough to know that if I didn't care, I wouldn't ask.~
@443 = ~Do not lie to me, Bhaalspawn. ~
@444 = ~You look ready to fall where you stand.~
@445 = ~Do you need to rest?~
@446 = ~Don't worry about it. Just make sure I don't collapse.~
@447 = ~I'll rest soon enough. A body without a soul can't function for long. ~
@448 = ~Very well. ~
@449 = ~Irenicus will pay for what he's done, <CHARNAME>.~
@450 = ~We WILL retrieve your soul, and then he will burn.~
@451 = ~You and I are similar in more ways than one, Bhaalspawn.~
@452 = ~What, apart from the fact we have fantastic tusks?~
@453 = ~We do both have excellent taste in men.~
@454 = ~We do both have excellent taste in partners.~
@455 = ~Aside from our shared love of all things murderous?~
@456 = ~What do you mean?~
@457 = ~We share our orcish blood, certainly. But that is not all.~
@458 = ~Apart from that.~
@459 = ~Yes, apart from even our shared bloodlust.~
@460 = ~We are both outcast. Labelled and cast aside by the world, the victims of our heritage.~
@461 = ~We are both outcast. Labelled and cast aside by the world, victims of our parentage.~
@462 = ~A grim outlook.~
@463 = ~Our heritage has caused us both problems, yes. In different ways, I'm sure, but life would certainly be easier were I not a Bhaalspawn.~
@464 = ~Our heritage has caused us both problems, yes. Life would certainly be easier were I not a half-orc Bhaalspawn.~
@465 = ~I don't know about that. I haven't found my heritage all that troublesome.~
@466 = ~Our upbringing was different, but at our core we are both strangers to the world around us. We make our way, but we are cast out and spat upon for our parentage.~
@467 = ~An accurate one.~
@468 = ~"Not all that troublesome." Hah! Those who know your true heritage recoil, in constant fear of their lives.~
@469 = ~We stand forever apart. Few know us, and fewer still understand us. ~
@470 = ~Fate has brought us together for a reason. Our destiny is writ large in the stars. One day, we will achieve our goals, and your glory and mine shall be known far and wide.~
@471 = ~And when that day comes, my love, what a celebration we shall have.~
@472 = ~You have a magnificent way with words.~
@473 = ~If you say so.~
@474 = ~I like the sound of that. We will shape our own future to our own liking, together.~
@475 = ~Yes. I do. We will shape our own future to our own liking, together.~
@476 = ~I swear to you, they will. You just wait. We will shape our own future to our own liking, together.~
@477 = ~The mage's plan was effective, it cannot be denied. Irenicus wields fear and panic like a seasoned warrior does sword and shield.~
@478 = ~It is... impressive.~
@479 = ~Hit them right and the most seasoned warrior will still fall.~
@480 = ~Admire him some other time, Dorn. We've matters to attend to.~
@481 = ~He is not one to trifle with, but neither are we. ~
@482 = ~Hold a moment.~
@483 = ~This is a beautiful sight. Had we more time, <CHARNAME>... I would take you where we stand, in the midst of this chaos. ~
@484 = ~Kiss me.~
@485 = ~With pleasure.~
@486 = ~We are literally in the middle of a battle. No.~
@487 = ~Then perhaps we are too different after all.~
@488 = ~You and I, <CHARNAME>... we will go far. ~
@489 = ~Now let us make this Irenicus suffer as his victims have suffered.~
@490 = ~You are MINE... and he will pay for his transgressions!~
@491 = ~You and the monk. ~
@492 = ~Me and Rasaad? What about us?~
@493 = ~Are none of your business.~
@494 = ~Definitely not.~
@495 = ~If you would be mine, you must be mine alone.~
@496 = ~I'm a person, Dorn. Not some object to be possessed.~
@497 = ~You know I am yours. You do know that, right?~
@498 = ~Then we are through.~
@499 = ~Good. ~
@500 = ~You are no object. But you do belong to me, as I do to you.~
@501 = ~You really are quite the romantic, aren't you?~
@502 = ~We don't owe each other anything.~
@503 = ~Wrong. Wrong, wrong, wrong.~
@504 = ~And the monk?~
@505 = ~Means nothing to me.~
@506 = ~He is... intriguing.~
@507 = ~So be it. You will come to regret this, <CHARNAME>.~
@508 = ~Decide whom you want, now. I'll not be anyone's second choice.~
@509 = ~And I won't respond positively to ultimatums.~
@510 = ~If I must choose, I would choose you, of course.~
@511 = ~You would challenge me, elf?~
@512 = ~<CHARNAME>. You desire him. But he will be mine.~
@513 = ~Hah! I may be a monster, but you are a gnat. Get in my way and I will squash you.~
@514 = ~You are no better than she. To Hells with you!~
@515 = ~What you thought is of no consequence. If you value your life, you will leave him to me.~
@516 = ~And good riddance.~
@517 = ~Said the halfling to the giant.~
@518 = ~You'll not best this one.~
@519 = ~Would you two like some privacy...?~
@520 = ~Dorn, leave Anomen alone. He should get used to it from now on.~
@521 = ~Anomen, you've no need to prove yourself to me. ~
@522 = ~You've made the right decision, <CHARNAME>. ~
@523 = ~You'll regret this decision, <CHARNAME>. He'll disappoint you in ways I never would.~
@524 = ~We will see.~
@525 = ~What treachery is this, <CHARNAME>?~ [OH95174]
@526 = ~Treachery?~
@527 = ~What are you talking about, Dorn?~
@528 = ~You accuse me of treachery? Watch your tongue, half-orc.~
@529 = ~Watch my tongue? I should cut yours from your vile mouth!~ [OH95175]
@530 = ~I leave you alone for fifteen seconds and you take some drow she-dog into your bed?~ [OH95176]
@531 = ~A minor point, but it would be more accurate to say she took me into her bed.~
@532 = ~Ah. Yes. Not my finest hour. A decent eight minutes, though, if I do say so myself.~
@533 = ~I do as I will, half-orc. If you've a problem with that, it's yours and yours alone. Deal with it or begone.~
@534 = ~I did no such thing.~
@535 = ~Damn accuracy and damn you! ~ [OH95177]
@536 = ~This insult cannot stand!~ [OH95178]
@537 = ~I am sorry, Dorn. It was a rash decision, made in the heat of the moment, and I regret it.~
@538 = ~Shh. The insult's very sensitive about having no legs. It lost them in an incident during the second Dragonspear War. Ugly battle. It wakes at night screaming, its bed drenched in sweat, the memory of that horrible day scarred into its very soul.~
@539 = ~It can and it will, half-orc. You do not own me.~
@540 = ~Jokes? You make jokes?~ [OH95179]
@541 = ~This one time, I'll permit you this... lapse of judgment. If you would see us fulfill our destiny, do not repeat it.~ [OH95180]
@542 = ~I should send you to the Abyss and let demons gnaw your soul for all eternity for this—push me one more time and I will, I swear it. Get out of my sight! You sicken me.~ [OH95181]
@543 = ~She meant nothing to me, Dorn. You are all that truly matters.~
@544 = ~I sicken you? Wow, I really did mess up, didn't I?~
@545 = ~Get over it, Dorn—and soon. I've no patience for your nonsense.~
@546 = ~Prove it, <CHARNAME>—if you can. You have your work cut out for you. Fail and you'll have something more cut OUT of you.~ [OH95182]
@547 = ~Such mockery does naught but stoke my fury, <CHARNAME>.~ [OH95183]
@548 = ~Regrets are for the weak, which is all you are. This pathetic episode proves it.~ [OH95184]
@549 = ~<CHARNAME>, a word?~ [OH74649]
@550 = ~I can't help but notice we haven't visited the Radiant Heart's temple recently, or that a certain cleric by the name of Firejaw continues to draw breath. When do you plan to rectify the situation?~ [OH74650]
@551 = ~In truth, Dorn, I find the notion disturbing. I'm not sure I'll be able to help you in this.~
@552 = ~Assassinating a priest of the Triad is no trivial matter. It'll take me a while to get comfortable with the idea.~
@553 = ~No time like the present.~
@554 = ~When I see fit, Dorn, and not a second sooner. If you've a problem with that, you're welcome to take your leave.~
@555 = ~I may just do that if we don't act soon.~ [OH74655]
@556 = ~Get comfortable soon, <PRO_RACE>. My patron's patience is not without limit.~ [OH74656]
@557 = ~If that's how it is, I'll take my leave of you.~ [OH74657]
@558 = ~Deal with my blade, foolish <PRO_RACE>!~ [OH74564]
@559 = ~So be it—the prospect of your soul has always excited my patron!~ [OH74549]
@560 = ~Then pay the price for your folly!~ [OH74555]
@561 = ~My patience grows thin, <CHARNAME>. How much longer do you intend to ignore the temple of the Radiant Heart?~ [OH74658]
@562 = ~As long as possible, though I gather I'm running out of time.~
@563 = ~How much longer is there?~
@564 = ~I shall ignore it as long as I choose. Is that a problem, half-orc?~
@565 = ~Your help would be appreciated, but it's not required.~ [OH74662]
@566 = ~I've given it a lot of thought, Dorn. I can't condone the assassination of a priest.~
@567 = ~All right, Dorn. You've twisted my arm. Let's go visit a temple.~
@568 = ~Your presence is no longer appreciated or required.~
@569 = ~You'll have no problems with me, <PRO_RACE>.~ [OH74666]
@570 = ~You would dismiss me, <CHARNAME>? Try dismissing my blade!~ [OH74667]
@571 = ~I know not, but would rather not find out the hard way.~ [OH74668]
@572 = ~There is nothing easy in the life you've chosen for yourself.~
@573 = ~Then we shall waste no more.~
@574 = ~You tremble like a rabbit at the thought of your patron's wrath. Your weakness sickens me.~
@575 = ~Your cowardice disgusts me, <PRO_RACE>. I'll be on my way.~ [OH74672]
@576 = ~You call me weak? Defend yourself, <PRO_RACE>!~ [OH74673]
@577 = ~Only a fool would try Ur-Gothoz's patience. I'll not be a party to my own destruction.~ [OH74674]
@578 = ~A pox upon you and the she-beast who spawned you, <PRO_RACE>. I'll not stand here and be insulted by the likes of you.~ [OH74675]
@579 = ~The rewards are worth the effort. I can wait no longer. I must return to the temple of the Radiant Heart.~ [OH74676]
@580 = ~Death to the Radiant Heart!~ [OH74682]
@581 = ~For you perhaps. For my master and I, it changes nothing.~ [OH74693]
@582 = ~Then I'm done with both you and your master.~
@583 = ~Let me attempt to change your mind.~
@584 = ~Well, nothing important, anyway. Let's get down to work.~
@585 = ~You don't want to cross Ur-Gothoz, and you certainly don't want to cross me.~ [OH74697]
@586 = ~You and that sword of yours make a persuasive argument. Very well. Let's go celebrate the couple's special day.~
@587 = ~I'm afraid what I want and what honor demands are very much at odds in this instance.~
@588 = ~You're not dealing with some shepherd wandering the Sword Coast now, Dorn. It'll take more than threats to steer me from my path.~
@589 = ~I spit upon your honor, and I'll do the same to your corpse!~ [OH74701]
@590 = ~I wasn't threatening you, <CHARNAME>, merely stating the facts. Like me, only sharp steel may turn you from your course. If we're at odds, I'll give you nothing less.~ [OH74702]
@591 = ~Then show me your steel, for on my honor I'll not let you do as Ur-Gothoz commands.~
@592 = ~I'm glad we understand each other. Now I believe we've a wedding to attend?~
@593 = ~You mean to leave?~ [OH74742]
@594 = ~You heard the man. We're not welcome here.~
@595 = ~I mean to leave this place covered in blood, starting with this whelp's.~
@596 = ~Cut him down!~
@597 = ~Too much talking, not enough slaughter!~ [OH74784]
@598 = ~The madness ends with your death, Firejaw! Not a second sooner.~ [OH91120]
@599 = ~Have it your way, <CHARNAME>. I've done what I came here to do.~ [OH74819]
@600 = ~Everyone out! But know that bloody vengeance will fall upon those who speak of what's occurred here this day.~
@601 = ~You've no need to fear me, <CHARNAME>, at least for as long as you're of use.~ [OH74821]
@602 = ~Then I hope I continue to be of use well into the future. Let me prove myself now.~
@603 = ~Comforting words, coming from such as you.~
@604 = ~I feel exactly the same way about you.~
@605 = ~They're as comforting as any you'll get from me, Bhaalspawn.~ [OH74825]
@606 = ~We make a good pair, <CHARNAME>. These others are weak, but you understand the nature of power.~ [OH74826]
@607 = ~It thrills me as it does you.~
@608 = ~I understand the desire to possess it.~
@609 = ~These others are useful, in their own way. Your single-mindedness is understandable, but subtlety has its uses.~
@610 = ~Are you mad, <CHARNAME>? Their tongues will wag like tickled dogs' tails the moment we leave. There's only one way to ensure their silence.~ [OH74831]
@611 = ~Bollard Firejaw is dead. You've done your duty. Let's be away from here before word gets out of what's occurred.~
@612 = ~Let them talk. The legend of Dorn Il-Khan's power will grow. But for now, we should take our leave—it won't be long before someone raises the alarm.~
@613 = ~The truth. There's something I never expected to hear from the mouth of Dorn Il-Khan. You're right, of course. While they live, these people are a threat, and that, I cannot abide.~
@614 = ~You're wrong, <CHARNAME>. Now let me do what must be done or better still, help me do it.~ [OH74835]
@615 = ~Go ahead. I've done my piece.~
@616 = ~Go ahead. I always enjoy watching you work.~
@617 = ~Very well. I can't let you have all the fun.~
@618 = ~You keep your subtlety, <CHARNAME>. I'll put my faith in my sword.~ [OH74839]
@619 = ~Rest your weary bones, <CHARNAME>. The strong and able-bodied will finish up here.~ [OH74840]
@620 = ~Then you shall find the next few minutes enjoyable indeed!~ [OH74841]
@621 = ~These wretches shall fall before us like wheat beneath a scythe!~ [OH74842]
@622 = ~You tell it true, <CHARNAME>. Hear my words, you pathetic scum! I spare your lives that you may spread word of this day. When anyone asks you of it, you'll tell them fortune smiled upon you: You encountered Dorn Il-Khan and lived to tell the tale.~ [OH74843]
@623 = ~Perhaps you're right, <PRO_RACE>. My work is done. Let us take our leave.~ [OH74844]
@624 = ~What say you, <CHARNAME>? Satisfied with the day's rewards?~ [OH74849]
@625 = ~Chaos, bloodshed, and plunder. What's not to love?~
@626 = ~Truth be told, I could be more satisfied. But I'll take what I can.~
@627 = ~My reward is the screams of the dying. Everything else is dessert.~
@628 = ~Our bloody work is done. The city guards will doubtless hear of this soon. Let us make haste, lest we risk discovery.~ [OH74854]
@629 = ~I'm afraid this is where we part ways, Dorn Il-Khan. You've got some issues to work out, and frankly I'd rather not be around to watch you do so.~
@630 = ~Now he wants to make haste. Oh well, better late than never. Come on, you big lug. Let's go find somewhere we can lurk menacingly in peace.~
@631 = ~Come with us. We could use someone with your talents.~
@632 = ~Our combined skills would make us a force to be reckoned with...~ [OH74861]
@633 = ~Now you're talking. Let's hit the cobblestones before the guards arrive.~
@634 = ~United, there's no limit to what we may accomplish.~
@635 = ~Just remember, you're the one who serves Ur-Gothoz. If your master's desires cross mine, there'll be trouble.~
@636 = ~<CHARNAME> and Dorn Il-Khan. We shall carve our names on the flesh of history.~ [OH74865]
@637 = ~That was disgusting.~
@638 = ~I've no love for Ur-Gothoz—just the power he can supply.~ [OH74867]
@639 = ~So long as we understand one another. Now, let us go.~
@640 = ~<CHARNAME>. I would have a word with you. ~ [OH74869]
@641 = ~In private.~ [OH74870]
@642 = ~Of course, Dorn. Always happy to talk with my favorite half-orc.~
@643 = ~If you must. What is it?~
@644 = ~Not right now, Dorn. I've other matters to attend to.~
@645 = ~My patron, Ur-Gothoz, compels me to act once again.~ [OH74874]
@646 = ~I'm sorry to hear that, but I can't help you right now. Ask again later.~
@647 = ~Again? Didn't we slaughter a priest just last week?~
@648 = ~What does he want of you this time?~
@649 = ~He demands another death—a paladin of Helm, named Terpfen.~ [OH74878]
@650 = ~Sounds straightforward enough.~
@651 = ~I guess someone named Terpfen's about to have a bad day. Then again, with a name like that, I don't imagine they've had many good days.~
@652 = ~And you're telling me this because...?~
@653 = ~I've checked around, and this Terpfen isn't at the temple of Helm.~ [OH74882]
@654 = ~Ah. That does rather complicate matters, doesn't it? Do you know where he is?~
@655 = ~I know who knows where he is.~ [OH74884]
@656 = ~Please tell me you know where that person is...~
@657 = ~His name's Guardian Telwyn, a paladin at the temple.~ [OH74886]
@658 = ~We should pay this Telwyn a visit.~
@659 = ~At least there's one paladin that knows his place. And as for Terpfen... we'll put him in his in due course.~
@660 = ~And you want my assistance in loosening this paladin's tongue.~
@661 = ~I could do it myself, of course. But after Firejaw's assassination, it seemed like the kind of thing you might enjoy.~ [OH74890]
@662 = ~You presume too much, Dorn. Visiting a temple with you lost what little luster it had after what happened last time.~
@663 = ~Why Dorn, I didn't know you cared.~
@664 = ~Spilling a paladin's blood does sound like an enjoyable distraction. Let's go pay our respects to Helm.~
@665 = ~I thought you shared my taste for blood and glory.~ [OH74894]
@666 = ~What you call glory, I call infamy, and I've more of that than any reasonable <PRO_RACE> could want at this point.~
@667 = ~My taste is for life and luxury. Blood and glory are but tools for me, not ends in themselves.~
@668 = ~I do. And soon we'll gorge ourselves upon them. ~
@669 = ~Power is the goal. But in this world, violence is the most effective way to attain and keep it. I embrace that reality. You should do the same.~
@670 = ~I understand you. I just don't know if I'm ready yet.~
@671 = ~We have enough in common, but I'm afraid I don't have a taste for the beating hearts of my enemies.~
@672 = ~Watch me carefully, Dorn. You might learn a thing or two about reveling in bloodshed.~
@673 = ~Then you're fortunate—and wise—to stand at my side.~ 
@674 = ~Hah! We'll see, <CHARNAME>, we'll see. But enough philosophy. We've business to attend to.~ [OH96109]
@675 = ~Telwyn stands sentry in Helm's temple every night. We could go tonight.~ [OH74898]
@676 = ~You and I share the same passions. These dogs you surround yourself with are naught but pawns in the great game of life and death we play.~ [OH74900]
@677 = ~And what am I, then? The queen or the king? The servant or the <PRO_MASTERMISTRESS>?~
@678 = ~You are my equal. There is no higher rank one can attain.~ [OH74902]
@679 = ~You insult and flatter in a single breath. Very well, then. We face this Telwyn as equals. Where, and when?~
@680 = ~You keep telling yourself that, Dorn. I'm sure it helps you sleep at night.~
@681 = ~You dare mock me, <PRO_RACE>? I'll cut out your tongue and use it to shine my boots!~ [OH74905]
@682 = ~Then you're of no use to me. Begone!~ [OH91176]
@683 = ~You're on a dark path, Dorn. I hope you see the light soon. Goodbye.~
@684 = ~If that's how you're going to be, I'll be more like you. Let's go kill a paladin.~
@685 = ~I go where I will, Dorn Il-Khan. You don't command me.~
@686 = ~Now you're talking like someone worthy to stand at my side.~ [OH91202]
@687 = ~Then decide, <CHARNAME>. Are you with me or not?~ [OH91203]
@688 = ~I'm with you, for now. Don't make me regret it.~
@689 = ~I want no part of this perfidy.~
@690 = ~I cannot allow you to kill this paladin, Dorn.~
@691 = ~You challenge me? So be it!~ [OH91207]
@692 = ~Regrets are for fools and weaklings. You don't strike me as either.~ [OH91208]
@693 = ~Then you are a weakling and a fool. I've no patience for either.~ [OH91209]
@694 = ~That's Telwyn over there.~ [OH74908]
@695 = ~All right. Let me do the talking.~
@696 = ~Put the sword back in the sheathe, big boy.~
@697 = ~Let's go put the fear of us in this Everwatch Knight.~
@698 = ~My blade thirsts for Everwatch Knight blood!~ [OH74912]
@699 = ~A dead knight won't tell us where Terpfen is.~
@700 = ~I wasn't going to kill him. Yet. Just scare him. Loosen his tongue. Perhaps you're rubbing off on me.~ [OH74915]
@701 = ~There are other ways to loosen a man's tongue. Ways that may not involve him summoning his fellow knights to defend his honor.~
@702 = ~What do you suggest?~ [OH74919]
@703 = ~Something slightly more nuanced. I'm going to ask him if he knows where Terpfen can be found.~
@704 = ~Something sneaky. If that doesn't work, well, Rancor's still there if we need her.~
@705 = ~I'm going to check this Telwyn out. See what makes him tick. Then... we'll see.~
@706 = ~I prefer the direct approach.~ [OH74924]
@707 = ~I prefer the effective approach. Let's try it my way and see what happens.~
@708 = ~You know this as well as I.~
@709 = ~You believe deceit is beneath beings of true power?~
@710 = ~As do I. But our preferences are secondary to our needs.~
@711 = ~I do. But beings of true power do not bow to distant masters.~
@712 = ~You dare insult me?~
@713 = ~I'm just giving you something to consider. You are not your own, Dorn Il-Khan. But stick with me, and that might change.~
@714 = ~I see in you a kindred spirit.~
@715 = ~Trust what you see.~
@716 = ~He's a man. Stab him and he bleeds. What more do you need to know?~ [OH74934]
@717 = ~Where to find Terpfen, for one. Hang back, and let me do the talking.~
@718 = ~Hrm.~ [OH74942]
@719 = ~Is this some jest, <CHARNAME>? You can't mean to leave this scuff-kneed wretch alive?~ [OH74959]
@720 = ~He's given us everything we need. Further bloodshed will only complicate matters.~
@721 = ~You're right. If there's one thing I cannot, it's loose ends. "Can knot." Get it? Oh, lighten up, Dorn. We've got what we came here for, and now you get to kill an Everwatch Knight in the bargain!~
@722 = ~Thanks a lot, Dorn. Now you've gone and spoiled my surprise.~
@723 = ~I don't mind such... complications. But we'll do as you wish, for now.~ [OH74963]
@724 = ~Make peace with your worthless god, Everwatch Knight, for soon you shall meet him face to face!~ [OH74964]
@725 = ~You should.~ [OH74975]
@726 = ~He's right. You should. Now if you'd be so kind as to tell us where we may find Guardian Terpfen, we'll be on our way.~
@727 = ~Stay your hand, <CHARNAME>. We need him alive. At least long enough to reveal Terpfen's location.~ [OH74988]
@728 = ~Right! Terpfen. I'd almost forgot. Start talking, knight.~
@729 = ~The blackguard tells me to stay my hand? Really?~
@730 = ~We are here to get Terpfen's location. Once we have that, I'll gladly watch you slit this worm's throat—I'll even give you a blade with which to do the deed.~ [OH74991]
@731 = ~I don't think worms have throats, but I get your point. Start talking, Telwyn. Where can we find Terpfen?~
@732 = ~A pleasure delayed is a pleasure enhanced, and killing this insect will be a pleasure. —Insect! I believe you were telling us where we can find Terpfen.~
@733 = ~The Abyss take Terpfen! I want this knight's blood!~
@734 = ~You think I don't? But Ur-Gothoz must be obeyed.~ [OH74995]
@735 = ~And you're happy with that arrangement?~
@736 = ~Your weakness disgusts me, Dorn. But we'll play it your way... for now. Telwyn! Where is Guardian Terpfen?~
@737 = ~Ur-Gothoz gives me what I need... for now. He will feel Rancor's kiss someday, this I swear. But for the moment, I must do as he commands.~ [OH74998]
@738 = ~I see a future where Dorn Il-Khan and <CHARNAME> do as they will, unfettered by the desires of others.~
@739 = ~That day will come.~ [OH75000]
@740 = ~Pray to whatever god still hears your voice I don't lose patience before it does. Guardian Telwyn, I believe you were telling us where to find your colleague, Terpfen?~
@741 = ~You are not.~ [OH75036]
@742 = ~I am not. Now where can we find Terpfen?~
@743 = ~I am Dorn Il-Khan! I seek the Everwatch dog Terpfen!~ [OH75061]
@744 = ~Forgive my friend. He's suffered many blows to the head and frequently mixes up words like "dog" and "knight."~
@745 = ~And then there's the direct approach.~
@746 = ~There is only one approach here, and it is mine.~ [OH75064]
@747 = ~Send him to me now, and you may yet live to see another day!~ [OH75065]
@748 = ~In the name of my master, Ur-Gothoz, you will all die.~ [OH75082]
@749 = ~All of them? I thought we were here for Terpfen?~
@750 = ~All must perish. Ur-Gothoz has altered my mission, and if you stand in my way, you should pray he does not alter it further.~ [OH75084]
@751 = ~Ur-Gothoz's whims are distressingly capricious. Is the power he supplies truly worth the effort he demands?~
@752 = ~Oh well, if Ur-Gothoz commands it, we must obey Ur-Gothoz, mustn't we?~
@753 = ~Don't lie to me, Dorn Il-Khan. Ur-Gothoz may demand their death, but you and I both enjoy a good slaughter.~
@754 = ~You tell me, <CHARNAME>.~ [OH75088]
@755 = ~You would mock my master, <CHARNAME>? We'll have words on this when the battle's done.~ [OH75089]
@756 = ~You know me well, <CHARNAME>, though I'd have you know me better still.~ [OH75090]
@757 = ~<CHARNAME>. Before the battle, you asked if the power Ur-Gothoz grants me is worth all that he orders me to do.~ [OH75091]
@758 = ~I did.~
@759 = ~I have no answer to that, at least none I find satisfactory.~ [OH75093]
@760 = ~And the unsatisfactory answer?~
@761 = ~You have much to consider, I think.~
@762 = ~At first, service to Ur-Gothoz seemed worthwhile, at least some of the time. But recently...~ [OH75096]
@763 = ~Yes?~
@764 = ~Bollard Firejaw was not the first man I was sent to kill without explanation. Nor will Terpfen be the last, I suspect.~ [OH75098]
@765 = ~I can only imagine how it feels to be bound in servitude.~
@766 = ~Being bound in servitude must rankle.~
@767 = ~You're becoming a tool rather than the champion you are meant to be.~
@768 = ~You alone understand me.~ [OH75102]
@769 = ~Ur-Gothoz is just an obstacle, Dorn. Even he cannot stand against the two of us.~
@770 = ~I hope you're right, <CHARNAME>. For both our sakes.~ [OH75104]
@771 = ~Much to consider. More to overcome.~ [OH75105]
@772 = ~Don't patronize me, <CHARNAME>. You know nothing of my burden.~ [OH75106]
@773 = ~Then share it with me.~
@774 = ~That's your choice, Dorn. No one's making you carry the burden alone.~
@775 = ~And care nothing for it, either.~
@776 = ~Pretty words, but hollow ones. I will deal with Ur-Gothoz. I and I alone.~ [OH75110]
@777 = ~If that is your wish, don't let me stand in your way.~
@778 = ~I am Dorn Il-Khan. No one stands in my way.~ [OH75112]
@779 = ~No one but yourself.~
@780 = ~No. The strong stand alone.~ [OH75114]
@781 = ~And the wise know two are stronger than one.~
@782 = ~We must talk, <CHARNAME>.~ [OH75116]
@783 = ~Before the battle, you mocked Ur-Gothoz.~ [OH75117]
@784 = ~Ah, you noticed that, did you? Well observed.~
@785 = ~Your service to that demon is your weakness, Dorn. It would rankle me to see you bound in service to anyone, never mind one as erratic as this Ur-Gothoz.~
@786 = ~You think me weak for serving him?~ [OH75120]
@787 = ~I do.~
@788 = ~I think you weakened, Dorn. Never weak.~
@789 = ~You think you aren't?~
@790 = ~Now you mock me?~ [OH75124]
@791 = ~Not at all. I merely asked a question.~
@792 = ~I mock the servant of Ur-Gothoz. Are you he?~
@793 = ~You know I am.~ [OH75127]
@794 = ~Then stop your incessant sulking and do something about it.~
@795 = ~When I look at you, I don't see a servant. I see Dorn Il-Khan. A warrior. Not some demon's errand boy.~
@796 = ~That's unfortunate. Once I thought you were so much more, but I see now that I was mistaken.~
@797 = ~Watch your tongue, <PRO_RACE>. You don't want to cross me regardless of whom I serve.~ [OH75131]
@798 = ~Forgive me, Dorn. I intended no harm.~
@799 = ~No one tells me what I want, Il-Khan. Unlike you, I do as I will.~
@800 = ~You watch my tongue, Dorn. You'd be surprised what it can accomplish.~
@801 = ~It'll take more than words to harm me, <CHARNAME>.~ [OH75135]
@802 = ~If anyone else said that to me, I'd cut them down where they stand. You're lucky I still have use for you.~ [OH75136]
@803 = ~Beshaba's favorite <PRO_SONDAUGHTER>, that's me.~
@804 = ~I might at that.~ [OH75138]
@805 = ~I cannot deny there's something to what you say.~ [OH75140]
@806 = ~Only a fool would try.~
@807 = ~Hah! A good day's work. Ur-Gothoz will be pleased.~ [OH75142]
@808 = ~I'm happy for him.~
@809 = ~And you, Dorn Il-Khan? Are you pleased?~
@810 = ~Ur-Gothoz means nothing to me. Would that you could say the same.~
@811 = ~Of course! There's nothing more refreshing than bathing in the blood of your enemies.~ [OH75146]
@812 = ~Terpfen wasn't your enemy. Just your target.~
@813 = ~Terpfen was no enemy of yours—not until Ur-Gothoz got involved.~
@814 = ~I'm with you. There's nothing like a good massacre to brighten one's day.~
@815 = ~My target is my enemy, at least so long as he still breathes.~ [OH75150]
@816 = ~Would that I could be blasé about serving the whims of another.~
@817 = ~No one's going to accuse Terpfen of doing that any time soon.~
@818 = ~What are you suggesting?~ [OH75153]
@819 = ~What I'm suggesting, my dear Dorn, is that your service to Ur-Gothoz does a disservice to you.~
@820 = ~Me? Not a thing. Far be it from me to criticize the Great and Powerful Ur-Gothoz.~
@821 = ~If you don't know what I'm suggesting, you deserve your miserable fate.~
@822 = ~You mock me?~ [OH75157]
@823 = ~Who are you to pass judgment on me?~ [OH75159]
@824 = ~I'm not judging. Merely making an observation. One you'd do well to consider.~
@825 = ~Hrmm... I appreciate the offer. Allow me to reciprocate!~ [OH75167]
@826 = ~Hrmm. The most elite of Tyr's paladins. I see they brought some clerics with them as well. It would seem that I am quite popular with their god.~ [OH75177]
@827 = ~It's been nice knowing you, Dorn.~
@828 = ~Where's your precious Ur-Gothoz now, Dorn?~
@829 = ~*sigh* In for a chicken, in for a henhouse. Come and get the half-orc, Traggor—if you've got the stones!~
@830 = ~Nowhere he can help me against such fighters as these.~ [OH75181]
@831 = ~I should have expected something like this. These Hammers are but the beginning. Ur-Gothoz's missions have made a target out of me.~ [OH75184]
@832 = ~I knew that guy was bad news.~
@833 = ~We're not dead yet.~
@834 = ~The servant pays for the master's crimes. At last you see your folly.~
@835 = ~I should have known better than to trust Ur-Gothoz after Simmeon's betrayal. A lesson learned too late.~ [OH75188]
@836 = ~Perhaps, perhaps not.~
@837 = ~As Gorion used to say, "Any day you learn something new is a good day." Though I fear we're about to put that to the test...~
@838 = ~Just make sure you remember the lesson after we've festooned the trees with the Hammers' intestines.~
@839 = ~You presume too much, <PRO_RACE>. Dorn Il-Khan needs no protection.~ [OH75206]
@840 = ~So be it. If that's the way you feel, the Hammers can have you.~
@841 = ~I count one, two, three, four... five paladins who say otherwise.~
@842 = ~I count one, two... seven... and... Well, the exact math doesn't matter. There's a pack of paladins here who say otherwise!~
@843 = ~I would never presume to tell you what you need, Dorn. Nevertheless, you have my protection, and you may be glad of it before this is over.~
@844 = ~I might at that.~ [OH75211]
@845 = ~Let's show these knights of Tyr the folly of their ways.~ [OH75212]
@846 = ~I will deliver your worthless hide to Ur-Gothoz myself, <CHARNAME>!~ [OH75213]
@847 = ~Ah! Curse Ur-Gothoz, curse the day I first heard his name, and curse me for not fleeing the moment it fouled my ears! I've followed his orders come hell, horror, and high water, and for what?~ [OH75223]
@848 = ~You know my name?~ [OH75238]
@849 = ~Stay your hand, <CHARNAME>. I would know who it is who demands my attention.~ [OH75246]
@850 = ~As you wish.~
@851 = ~Show some spine, <CHARNAME>.~ [OH75247]
@852 = ~And turn my back on someone like her? Strategy never was your strong suit, Dorn.~
@853 = ~I've got a feeling any spine I showed would quickly be torn from my body. Best to let the lady talk.~
@854 = ~Strong words, coming from Ur-Gothoz's puppet.~
@855 = ~I need no strategy to still your impudent tongue—~ [OH75251]
@856 = ~I'll have your head for that—~ [OH75253]
@857 = ~I swear, <CHARNAME>, if you don't cease your prattling, I'll sew your mouth shut.~ [OH75258]
@858 = ~Dorn, sewing! I'd like to see that. Fine, I'll pipe down.~
@859 = ~What could you have that would possibly be of interest to me?~ [OH75266]
@860 = ~Seriously? I mean... really?~
@861 = ~Just a suggestion, Dorn, but maybe consider speaking to the scary woman in a slightly more civil tone?~
@862 = ~Power. Why else go to such extreme lengths to contact you?~
@863 = ~I'll speak my piece in whatever tone I choose, <PRO_RACE>.~ [OH75270]
@864 = ~I'll send flowers to your funeral.~
@865 = ~What could matter more than power?~ [OH75274]
@866 = ~Sympathy? You waste your energy and my time. Give me something useful or begone.~ [OH75277]
@867 = ~Tell me more.~ [OH75279]
@868 = ~You have traveled further on less. I would know more of this circle.~ [OH75286]
@869 = ~You can show me how to do this?~ [OH75288]
@870 = ~Trust her? Never. But the chance of bending Ur-Gothoz to my will is a temptation too great to be resisted.~ [OH75293]
@871 = ~You're a fool, Dorn Il-Khan. A whiff of power and you let yourself be pulled around like a bull with a ring in its nose.~
@872 = ~The decision is yours. I hope you don't come to regret it.~
@873 = ~I'm with you. To see the demon suffer is worth the risk. ~
@874 = ~Why would you offer this to me, woman?~ [OH75297]
@875 = ~Keep talking, <CHARNAME>, and you'll get more than a whiff of the power I command.~ [OH75298]
@876 = ~You know my feelings on this, Dorn. Make your choice.~
@877 = ~Of all the men and women I've encountered, <CHARNAME>, I believe only you have truly understood me.~ [OH75300]
@878 = ~That's because we seek the same things.~
@879 = ~Revenge drives us together.~ [OH75306]
@880 = ~I see your point, <CHARNAME>, but you're right. My path is already chosen.~ [OH75309]
@881 = ~Very well, Azothet. I shall begin the trek to Resurrection Gorge directly. But be warned: At the first hint of betrayal, I'll—~ [OH75310]
@882 = ~Hrmm. "Friend"? Dream on, witch.~ [OH75312]
@883 = ~Explain what?~ [OH75316]
@884 = ~Your wit is duller than a blind man's hammer, <CHARNAME>.~ [OH75320]
@885 = ~You love it.~
@886 = ~I assumed that it was your doing.~ [OH75328]
@887 = ~He has a... temperament, to be sure.~ [OH75334]
@888 = ~Damn you, <CHARNAME>, if you don't stop talking, the next thing you eat will be your own teeth.~ [OH75336]
@889 = ~I am a loyal servant of Ur-Gothoz. Our bond shall never be severed.~ [OH75346]
@890 = ~Other than a minute ago, you mean.~
@891 = ~How lucky Ur-Gothoz is to have a dog as affectionate as you.~
@892 = ~Of course. Only a blind fool could doubt your loyalty.~
@893 = ~I'll have your head for this, you traitorous mongrel...~ [OH75364]
@894 = ~You know I lack the power to accomplish such a thing. I cannot explain it. I tell you I am a loyal servant, and I've the blood on my hands to prove it. If that does not persuade you, nothing I can say will either.~ [OH75377]
@895 = ~I cannot explain that. Ur-Gothoz knows I lack the power to sever our connection.~ [OH75379]
@896 = ~I tell you I am a loyal servant, and I've the blood on my hands to prove it. If you can't accept that, nothing I say will change your mind.~ [OH75380]
@897 = ~Are you mad, <CHARNAME>? Prostrate yourself on the floor and beg Ur-Gothoz for mercy, or by the gods above and all the demons below, I'll stain the ground you stand on crimson with your blood!~ [OH75383]
@898 = ~You're the one who's slipped the bounds of sanity. Would you truly slay a friend—perhaps your only friend—at this demon's word?~
@899 = ~I... didn't know.~ [OH75390]
@900 = ~Allow to explain, O great Ur-Gothoz. There are few that have earned Dorn's trust, fewer still he will confide in. I am fortunate to count myself among that number. So it was to me he came with his concern that the nature of your connection had changed recently. You have seemed... distant, to him. So much so that he feared he might lose you. I thought I might assist, using certain of my skills to strengthen your bond, but I miscalculated. Instead, I temporarily cut the tie that binds you together. I am lucky indeed that you appeared—had you not, I've no doubt I'd already be writhing on the end of Dorn's sword.~
@901 = ~It would be my honor, master.~ [OH75396]
@902 = ~Well, I'm glad we got that sorted out.~
@903 = ~All's well that ends well. For everyone but Azothet, that is.~
@904 = ~Does your knee ever get sore from bending all the time?~
@905 = ~Curse you, <CHARNAME>! I do what I must to survive and thrive, and if that means your death, so be it!~ [OH75400]
@906 = ~So you would slay a friend—perhaps your only one—at the word of this foul glabrezu?~
@907 = ~I'm disappointed, Dorn. I thought better of you.~
@908 = ~You call serving this pathetic glabrezu thriving? You're even more stupid than you are ugly.~
@909 = ~Yes.~ [OH75404]
@910 = ~Look at him, Ur-Gothoz. Look at the mighty Dorn Il-Khan, shaming himself for your benefit. How can you possibly doubt his loyalty?~
@911 = ~Your groveling disgusts me. Draw your weapon. I'll die before I endure another second of your wretched mewling before this pathetic lackwit of a demon.~
@912 = ~Think again!~ [OH75407]
@913 = ~I hope you savored those words, <CHARNAME>, for they will be your last!~ [OH75408]
@914 = ~It is, my lord.~ [OH75412]
@915 = ~A pox upon you, <CHARNAME>! I do as I must to survive and thrive.~ [OH75419]
@916 = ~And to do that, you must obey your master. Pathetic lickspittle. You disgust me.~
@917 = ~Better to die than live in servitude!~
@918 = ~Your death was inevitable, <CHARNAME>. I hope your gods are merciful, for you know I am not.~ [OH75423]
@919 = ~You couldn't resist, could you, <PRO_RACE>? You had to slip the knife in!~ [OH75425]
@920 = ~Forgive me, my friend. Demons always bring out the worst in me.~
@921 = ~Your groveling disgusts me. Draw your weapon. I'll die before I endure another second of your wretched mewling.~
@922 = ~When I'm done with you, I'll wear your skin as a loincloth!~ [OH75428]
@923 = ~Are you mad, <CHARNAME>? Prostrate yourself on the floor and beg Ur-Gothoz for mercy, or by the gods above and all the demons below, I'll stain the ground you stand on crimson with your blood!~ [OH75429]
@924 = ~Yes.~ [OH75431]
@925 = ~You yourself invoked the name of Azothet.~ [OH75434]
@926 = ~Ah. I did do that, didn't I? ~
@927 = ~It is my honor to serve you, Ur-Gothoz.~ [OH75440]
@928 = ~Resurrection Gorge. Just as Azothet described.~ [OH75444]
@929 = ~Great. Let's go somewhere else now.~
@930 = ~With a little effort, this could be a very welcoming place. Some yardwork, a little gardening, burning the entire place to the ground. It has potential.~
@931 = ~You won't be able to put off your decision much longer.~
@932 = ~No. We've come too far to turn back.~ [OH75449]
@933 = ~Dorn's bloody path

Thanks to Telwyn, we now know the paladin Terpfen can be found in a camp south of the city. We shall proceed there and finish him off, as Ur-Gothoz demands.~
@934 = ~Speak for yourself. I found the journey here very relaxing; I'm sure the return trip will be just as pleasant.~
@935 = ~You're right, of course. Lead on, Dorn Il-Khan. Our doom awaits.~
@936 = ~I suppose you're right. Azothet and Ur-Gothoz mustn't be kept waiting.~
@937 = ~Doom awaits us, 'tis true. But not ours, <CHARNAME>. Not ours.~ [OH75453]
@938 = ~You've made your decision then?~
@939 = ~Between Azothet and Ur-Gothoz? No, not yet.~ [OH75455]
@940 = ~Best make your mind up quickly. If Azothet spoke true, you haven't much time left.~
@941 = ~Let your glib tongue rest a moment, <CHARNAME>. This place reeks of power.~ [OH75457]
@942 = ~It also reeks of death and madness.~
@943 = ~Death and madness are common companions to such as us.~ [OH75459]
@944 = ~Us?~
@945 = ~You know we seek the same things. Power. Glory. These are what drive us forward.~ [OH75461]
@946 = ~I think you've mistaken me for someone else. Someone considerably more unstable than I.~
@947 = ~Power and glory are a means to achieve comfort and contentment.~
@948 = ~ 'Tis true. Alone, we are forces to be reckoned with. Together, we are unstoppable.~
@949 = ~You disappoint me. I thought in you I'd found a kindred spirit. Together, we have done much. But we could do so much more.~ [OH75465]
@950 = ~My decision?~ [OH75466]
@951 = ~Whom do you serve? Ur-Gothoz? Azothet? Or yourself?~
@952 = ~Be silent, <CHARNAME>. Ur-Gothoz's ears and eyes are ever upon me.~ [OH75468]
@953 = ~Therein lies the problem, I think.~
@954 = ~There is strength in solitude.~ [OH75494]
@955 = ~Joy is irrelevant. All that matters is power. Power to accomplish whatever you please!~ [OH75496]
@956 = ~We're not here to discuss philosophy. Who are you, woman?~
@957 = ~Speak for yourself, <PRO_RACE>. I'll not feign weakness attempting to ingratiate myself to this... filth.~ [OH75500]
@958 = ~You'll have to forgive my friend. He was born in an alley in a particularly nasty part of town and raised in a barn that was only marginally more sanitary. I am <CHARNAME>. Whom do I have the honor of addressing?~
@959 = ~Then feign muteness, you lumbering imbecile. I'm trying to have a civilized conversation here.~
@960 = ~Then be silent and ingratiate yourself to me.~
@961 = ~...Very well.~ [OH75504]
@962 = ~Good! Now then. Allow me to introduce myself. I am <CHARNAME>. The rock in the armor there is Dorn. And you are...?~
@963 = ~You go too far, <CHARNAME>! Die!~ [OH75506]
@964 = ~You go too far, <CHARNAME>. Any further and you'll have a brief but enlightening discussion with the edge of my sword.~ [OH75507]
@965 = ~I look forward to it. But for now, I'd like to talk with... I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name.~
@966 = ~Watch yourself, <PRO_RACE>. Summerheigh. Tell us more of the creature that stalks the gorge. How did it come to be there?~ [OH75536]
@967 = ~Die, wretch!~ [OH75541]
@968 = ~Does it look like it worked?~ [OH75547]
@969 = ~Hey, I was just asking.~
@970 = ~She made him weak with her coddling.~ [OH75554]
@971 = ~She loved him as a mother should a son. Ignore the half-orc, Summerheigh. Please, continue.~
@972 = ~Hah! There's the <CHARNAME> I remember!~ [OH75560]
@973 = ~Die, hag!~ [OH75565]
@974 = ~Join your son in death, you wretched sow!~ [OH75572]
@975 = ~The strong make their own luck, <CHARNAME>. ~ [OH75582]
@976 = ~The wise know better than to refuse gifts from the gods. Farewell, Summerheigh.~
@977 = ~Some things die sooner than others—especially things that would bar my way.~ [OH75602]
@978 = ~She said the monster will corrupt—~ [OH75618]
@979 = ~I heard what she said, Dorn. I just hoped I heard it wrong.~
@980 = ~You forget yourself, <CHARNAME>. Our reasons for coming here are not so abstract.~ [OH75620]
@981 = ~Servant?~ [OH75626]
@982 = ~I will not fail.~ [OH75636]
@983 = ~In which case, imaginable evil will be unleashed upon the world. I guess that's a slight improvement.~
@984 = ~You know what I love about you, Dorn? Yeah, me neither. Let's go.~
@985 = ~Failure is for the weak. Whatever lurks within the gorge will fall before us like wheat to a scythe.~
@986 = ~You know full well why we're here, <CHARNAME>.~ [OH75647]
@987 = ~I do. I'm not convinced you can say the same.~
@988 = ~Of course. I was merely trying to spare good Summerheigh here a long and boring story. It's not like we've an abundance of time left to us, from the sounds of it.~
@989 = ~For pity's sake, Dorn, you could teach a lemon a thing or two about being sour.~
@990 = ~And what if it is?~ [OH75654]
@991 = ~If you can't respect our motives, at least give us points for honesty.~
@992 = ~We must make our way into the gorge. Nothing else matters.~ [OH75655]
@993 = ~There's a bigger picture, Dorn. ~
@994 = ~There are those who would disagree.~
@995 = ~The singularity of your vision is overwhelming. Would that I had your focus.~
@996 = ~Perhaps for you, <CHARNAME>. Not for me.~ [OH75659]
@997 = ~Such a narrow view will cost you dearly—and may cost the world much more.~
@998 = ~Well said, Dorn. In this venture, what you seek is the only prize that matters.~
@999 = ~Then let's tarry no longer with this withered husk. The circle awaits.~ [OH75662]
@1000 = ~What care I for the world?~ [OH75663]
@1001 = ~There is great power to be had here.~ [OH75666]
@1002 = ~None who matter, <CHARNAME>. Let us waste no more breath on this shriveled prune. My destiny bids me move forward.~ [OH75672]
@1003 = ~You should learn from their wisdom, hag.~ [OH75679]
@1004 = ~Well said. Let's tarry no longer with this wizened hag. The tree awaits.~ [OH75681]
@1005 = ~We could simply take them.~ [OH75690]
@1006 = ~While we're at it, we could put a target on our backs for every faerie and woodland beast 'twixt us and the gorge.~
@1007 = ~Dorn, if you could see your way clear to not being quite so... Dorn-ish for a few minutes, it sure would make my life easier.~
@1008 = ~Indeed. Hand over the goods, druid.~
@1009 = ~I've faced worse in my time.~ [OH75694]
@1010 = ~I'm sure you have, but why face it at all if we don't have to?~
@1011 = ~You'll face worse than that in a couple seconds if you don't smarten up and treat this woman with the respect she deserves.~
@1012 = ~You threaten me, Bhaalspawn?~ [OH75697]
@1013 = ~I tell you a simple truth you'd do well to take to heart.~
@1014 = ~Very well. Dither with the hag for the rest of the day, play crosses and noughts till the sun rises. I care not.~ [OH75699]
@1015 = ~Take my blade to heart, <PRO_RACE>!~ [OH75700]
@1016 = ~I am what I am, <CHARNAME>. Take it or don't; Dorn Il-Khan changes for no <PRO_MANWOMAN>.~ [OH75701]
@1017 = ~I don't ask you to change, Dorn. I ask only for silence. That's usually something you're only too willing to provide. Now then, Summerheigh. What of these goods you spoke of?~
@1018 = ~When this is over, I'll cut this tree down or see it burned to ashes.~ [OH75735]
@1019 = ~You're not afraid of heights, are you Dorn?~
@1020 = ~These boots were made for walking and occasionally kicking in the skull of a fallen enemy. Not scrambling through the boughs of some gods-forsaken oak.~ [OH75737]
@1021 = ~I do.~ [OH75751]
@1022 = ~Well, we don't always get what we want. For instance, you don't get to keep whittling this halfling.~
@1023 = ~Ignore the half-orc. He wishes to harm everyone further; it's just his way.~
@1024 = ~I do too, now that you mention it.~
@1025 = ~I'll wear your intestines like garlands in my hair, you halfling nuisance!~ [OH75755]
@1026 = ~It's your lucky day, halfling. Take what's still attached to your body and go before I change my mind.~ [OH75756]
@1027 = ~Count me glad you didn't!~ [OH75782]
@1028 = ~Mind your tongue, <PRO_RACE>.~ [OH75804]
@1029 = ~What? I merely suggested—~
@1030 = ~Yes, sir. Minding my tongue, sir.~
@1031 = ~Why, when you seem satisfied to watch it for me?~
@1032 = ~I know what you were suggesting. I suggest you shut your mouth before I shut it permanently.~ [OH75808]
@1033 = ~I always keep an eye on my enemy's weapons.~ [OH75809]
@1034 = ~You wound me, Dorn. And not the way you usually wound people, either. This hurts.~
@1035 = ~So you think me an enemy?~
@1036 = ~You think my tongue is dangerous? Don't leave yourself open like that.~
@1037 = ~I think you are wise enough to know when you no longer need me as a friend.~ [OH75813]
@1038 = ~I don't stand with you because of your tactical value, Dorn. I actually like you, though only the gods know why.~
@1039 = ~You think me a friend?~
@1040 = ~I never needed you as a friend, Dorn, and don't think yourself one now. I use you to my own benefit, as you do me.~
@1041 = ~I'm glad we understand each other.~ [OH75817]
@1042 = ~I think you're playing games with me now.~ [OH75818]
@1043 = ~Perhaps I am.~
@1044 = ~You may come to regret that.~ [OH75820]
@1045 = ~Perhaps I will.~
@1046 = ~Die, tree-hag!~ [OH75839]
@1047 = ~Death to all who stand between me and the circle!~ [OH75847]
@1048 = ~Don't try to stand in our way, dryad.~ [OH75860]
@1049 = ~I'll cut you into quarters, halfling!~ [OH75866]
@1050 = ~What color is dryad's blood, I wonder?~ [OH75876]
@1051 = ~What concern is it of yours?~ [OH75879]
@1052 = ~Enough of your prattling, <CHARNAME>. Dryad! Who are you who thinks to stand between me and my goal?~ [OH75884]
@1053 = ~You go too far, <PRO_RACE>.~ [OH75899]
@1054 = ~You make me sad, Dorn. All this time together and you still can't take a joke.~
@1055 = ~Really? That was too far? Tell the truth now, Dorn—you've moved the line, haven't you?~
@1056 = ~I go where I would, half-orc. Only a fool would try and stop me.~
@1057 = ~You call me a fool?~ [OH75903]
@1058 = ~If you act the fool, I'll tell you so.~
@1059 = ~Hah! No. How foolish would that make me?~
@1060 = ~One who acts like a fool should expect no better.~
@1061 = ~So, you are calling me a fool?~ [OH75907]
@1062 = ~I'm not calling you anything. Curb your paranoia, Dorn. I fear it will drive you to madness.~
@1063 = ~*sigh* No, Dorn, of course not. Only a fool would call you a fool. And I'm no fool.~
@1064 = ~Only because you're being one.~
@1065 = ~I may not have your way with words, <CHARNAME>, but I know how to win an argument.~ [OH75911]
@1066 = ~I'll not stand here and be mocked by the likes of you!~ [OH75932]
@1067 = ~You're looking for an insult where none was intended, Dorn.~
@1068 = ~Perhaps you should sit, then.~
@1069 = ~I'll sit on your corpse!~ [OH75935]
@1070 = ~Your insolent tongue will be the death of you, <CHARNAME>.~ [OH75936]
@1071 = ~Perhaps you're right. But I'm not inclined to cut it out, so I'll just have to live with it as long as I'm able. Yarrow, pray continue your tale.~
@1072 = ~You would be wise to fear me, <CHARNAME>. Or at least to pretend you do.~ [OH75938]
@1073 = ~I should be able to manage that. I'm a pretty good actor.~
@1074 = ~I would be wise to flee you. But here I am.~
@1075 = ~Fear you? Surely you jest. I've more to fear from my shadow.~
@1076 = ~I'll wager your shadow's sword doesn't cut like mine.~ [OH75942]
@1077 = ~You may not fear me, but you know my value.~ [OH75950]
@1078 = ~I do, but we can discuss that later. For now, I would know more about the beast that stalks Resurrection Gorge.~
@1079 = ~We'll see what lessons it can teach dancing on the end of my blade. Then perhaps you will be the one to learn something from the demon.~ [OH75958]
@1080 = ~His corpse serves as a fitting monument to his failure.~ [OH75959]
@1081 = ~I agree. The state of the tree and a bloodthirsty tanar'ri stalking the gorge is really kind of redundant after that.~
@1082 = ~He'd probably have preferred some kind of plaque.~
@1083 = ~Indeed. The weak and foolish deserve no better.~
@1084 = ~Calling me a fool will cost you your life sooner than my supposed foolishness will cost me mine.~ [OH75968]
@1085 = ~Sap is a poor substitute for blood, but I'll shed it all the same.~ [OH75971]
@1086 = ~There is nothing mindless about it, <PRO_RACE>.~ [OH75972]
@1087 = ~Simmeon, Ur-Gothoz, now Azothet... They called the tune and you danced the dance, all for power. Was it worth it?~
@1088 = ~Not all of us had the good fortune to be a child of Bhaal. When the opportunity for power presents itself, I have little choice but to take it.~ [OH75974]
@1089 = ~There's more to life than power, Dorn.~
@1090 = ~"Little choice"? You make excuses for your own base appetites.~
@1091 = ~Agreed. Power is all that matters.~
@1092 = ~Desiring power requires no excuse. Power is both the end and the means. Everything else is but a distraction.~ [OH75978]
@1093 = ~Your pitifully limited view cripples your own ambitions.~
@1094 = ~We'll see, <PRO_RACE>. We'll see. For now, we've more pressing concerns. Dryad. What more can you tell us of the tanar'ri who haunts the gorge?~ [OH75980]
@1095 = ~Save your pity for yourself, <PRO_RACE>. It's more than your ambition I'll cripple.~ [OH75981]
@1096 = ~And there's power here, that much is obvious. Dryad! Tell us more of what awaits us in Resurrection Gorge.~ [OH75982]
@1097 = ~A life without power is hardly worth living.~ [OH75983]
@1098 = ~A life without love is hardly worth living.~
@1099 = ~Yet there are hundreds of thousands—millions—of people who endure without power. And many of those are happy.~
@1100 = ~"Hardly" worth living? A life without power's not worth living at all. ~
@1101 = ~Love? You jest.~ [OH75987]
@1102 = ~All the power in the realms will be meaningless if you are alone.~
@1103 = ~Only a fool would willingly share such power.~ [OH75989]
@1104 = ~Love makes fools of us all.~
@1105 = ~Only a fool would ignore the power to be had in combining forces with a worthy mate.~
@1106 = ~An alliance of equals is a different matter altogether.~ [OH75992]
@1107 = ~Is it? A love shared between unequal partners is built on a foundation of shifting sand. An alliance of equals focused on a mutual goal—the acquisition of power, say—is the sort of ground love needs to bloom.~
@1108 = ~Love alone might not be enough in that case. There has to be common goal uniting the two...~
@1109 = ~Agreed. The benefits reaped are doubled.~
@1110 = ~Blind commoner fools, happy to be led by the strong.~ [OH75996]
@1111 = ~But happy nonetheless.~
@1112 = ~You disappoint me, <CHARNAME>. I thought we were of a shared purpose. ~ [OH75998]
@1113 = ~You thought wrong. I aspire to noble deeds, while you are satisfied indulging your baser instincts.~
@1114 = ~Once, perhaps. But now I'm not so sure.~
@1115 = ~We do. For such as us, there can be no happiness without power.~
@1116 = ~Such aspirations are no fitting goals for a child of Bhaal.~ [OH76002]
@1117 = ~Nevertheless, I strive to do good where I can. And it seems there are opportunities aplenty to do so here.~
@1118 = ~What could prompt such a change in heart?~ [OH76005]
@1119 = ~This place affects me in a way I'd never imagined possible. A balance has been upset here, and I must right it or die in the attempt.~
@1120 = ~You have, Dorn Il-Khan. Seeing your potential wasted in service to Simmeon, Ur-Gothoz, now Azothet... At all times you seek power, yet your efforts result only in servitude to another. You've chosen your path, and I respect that. But I see now where it leads, and that is nowhere I want to go.~
@1121 = ~What can I say? I'm fickle. ~
@1122 = ~Curse your eyes, <CHARNAME>! You see my quandary but offer me no solutions.~ [OH76009]
@1123 = ~I have nothing to offer but my support. I have faith in you, Dorn. You'll find a way through this.~
@1124 = ~A time will come—soon, I think—when you'll need to choose between freedom and power. When that time comes, I pray you make the right decision.~
@1125 = ~Find your own solutions, Il-Khan. I've better things to do with my time than dwell on your problems.~
@1126 = ~Your faith in others is a weakness; your faith in me crosses the line into foolhardiness. You know I tolerate you only so long as you are of use to me.~ [OH76015]
@1127 = ~Faith in others is no weakness. What is your tolerance of my whimsical nature if not a sign of your faith in my continued value?~
@1128 = ~Then I shall endeavor to continue to be of use to you.~
@1129 = ~Likewise.~
@1130 = ~Freedom or power? That's no choice at all.~ [OH76019]
@1131 = ~That's the attitude that led you to Simmeon, to Ur-Gothoz...~
@1132 = ~Enough, <PRO_RACE>. You've made your point.~ [OH76021]
@1133 = ~Then let's move on. Yarrow, I believe you were telling us about a tanar'ri?~
@1134 = ~Yet here you are at Resurrection Gorge. ~ [OH76023]
@1135 = ~I've my own reasons for that, half-orc. Do not presume that your presence here influences me in any way. Now, dryad. Continue with your tale.~
@1136 = ~A sign of madness, I sometimes think.~ [OH76026]
@1137 = ~A touch of madness may not be a bad thing where we're going. What more can you tell us of the gorge and this tanar'ri, Yarrow?~
@1138 = ~Your service is appreciated.~ [OH76028]
@1139 = ~It's nice to feel appreciated. Now, Yarrow, tell us more about this tanar'ri.~
@1140 = ~Have a care, Dorn. I serve only myself, unlike some half-orcs I could mention.~
@1141 = ~Imply I'm your servant again and you won't appreciate what happens next.~
@1142 = ~Watch yourself, Bhaalspawn.~ [OH76032]
@1143 = ~Ha! There's the <CHARNAME> I know. I wondered where <PRO_HESHE> had gotten to. But enough banter. Dryad, what more can you tell us of the tanar'ri and the gorge?~ [OH76033]
@1144 = ~My tree's state is no memorial to events passed.~
@1145 = ~If you're of a mind, you can leave one when we complete our task. For now, we should focus on what awaits us. The summoning circle, dryad. Where is it?~ [OH76035]
@1146 = ~Your wit is duller than a dwarf's hammer. The summoning circle. Where is it?~ [OH76045]
@1147 = ~Better to live and crawl than to die for no reason. There's no way to know what end awaits until it arrives.~ [OH76047]
@1148 = ~You surprise me, Dorn. I can't imagine you being satisfied dying in bed.~
@1149 = ~Life is the ultimate battle. I may not ultimately prevail, but I'll fight it to my dying breath regardless of where I take it.~ [OH76049]
@1150 = ~But enough of this. We seek the circle of summoning. Where is it?~ [OH76050]
@1151 = ~We're not here for a history lesson. We're here for the circle and the sword.~ [OH76055]
@1152 = ~Those things are unimportant compared to restoring the tree to its former glory and bringing balance back to the land.~
@1153 = ~I suspect finding them will be quicker and easier with Yarrow's help. Pray continue, Yarrow.~
@1154 = ~You're right, Dorn. Let's not waste our time with this dryad.~
@1155 = ~Pfah! Your sudden nobility sickens me, <CHARNAME>.~ [OH76066]
@1156 = ~Suffer in silence, Dorn. Yarrow has much more to tell us, I'm sure.~
@1157 = ~Well said, <CHARNAME>. Nothing shall stand between us and the circle.~ [OH76068]
@1158 = ~I don't doubt your strength, <PRO_RACE>. I cannot in truth say the same of your sanity or your wisdom.~ [OH76071]
@1159 = ~You would have us fear bones? I'll grind them to powder with my teeth!~ [OH76073]
@1160 = ~Stop interrupting the woman, Dorn. I apologize for my friend's enthusiasm, Yarrow. Is there anything more you can tell us of the gorge?~
@1161 = ~Ah! Suddenly I understand the sorry state of your breath.~
@1162 = ~Those who came before were too weak to survive the gorge. They failed in life; I'll not fear them in death.~
@1163 = ~Make another remark of that nature and you'll also understand the sorry state of your breathing.~ [OH76079]
@1164 = ~There's nothing wrong with my breathing—wait, I just got it. Never mind. Yarrow, continue.~
@1165 = ~You would threaten me, half-orc?~
@1166 = ~You would insult me, <PRO_RACE>?~ [OH76082]
@1167 = ~I did but make a joke.~
@1168 = ~I do as I will. You should know better than to challenge me.~
@1169 = ~Those who joke at my expense will find they pay a steep price.~ [OH76085]
@1170 = ~I'm sorry, my friend. I meant no offense. Please continue, Yarrow.~
@1171 = ~And you should know better than to insult a blackguard.~ [OH76087]
@1172 = ~If you've a problem with my attitude... Well then, you've a problem. Deal with it on your own time; we've other matters to attend to right now.~
@1173 = ~When this is over, you and I will have words, <CHARNAME>.~ [OH76089]
@1174 = ~I look forward to it. But for now, Yarrow, please go on.~
@1175 = ~I'll deal with your flippant tongue now, you impertinent dog!~ [OH76091]
@1176 = ~That blade will be mine before this is done.~ [OH76096]
@1177 = ~If you're quite finished with your prattling, can we get on with this? The ebon blade calls out to me; I can hear it.~ [OH76109]
@1178 = ~Enough talk! Let's be on our way.~ [OH76112]
@1179 = ~I may be selfish, but I'm no hypocrite. You allow us passage only because we might save your blighted lover. And you reward failure with certain death. You wrap your self-serving actions in noble words, but it all amounts to the same thing.~ [OH76120]
@1180 = ~The tanar'ri can take you and your halfling toadie! Nothing shall stand between me and my destiny!~ [OH76131]
@1181 = ~Speak for yourself, <CHARNAME>. I intend to walk out of the gorge alive—and with greater power than any I've wielded before.~ [OH76134]
@1182 = ~An intention is the most common victim of reality, but I'm with you. We can prevail in our quest if we work together.~
@1183 = ~The best laid plans of gods and men often go awry. And frankly, our plan wasn't that well laid to begin with.~
@1184 = ~And I shall walk beside you. Yarrow, what is the way into the gorge?~
@1185 = ~We have a goal; if anything gets between us and it, we cut it to bloody ribbons. What more of a plan could we need?~ [OH76141]
@1186 = ~I favor a more nuanced approach.~
@1187 = ~I'd prefer one that includes an option for running, if possible.~
@1188 = ~Best to keep things simple. Yarrow, how do we enter the gorge?~
@1189 = ~Nuance is for those who lack the strength to face their problems in a forthright manner.~ [OH76145]
@1190 = ~There's more to life than obstacles and goals, Dorn. Sometimes you've got to stop and smell the roses.~
@1191 = ~Your "forthright manner" generally involves shedding someone's blood. There's some room in this life we've chosen for finesse, you know.~
@1192 = ~The gorge is no place for the weak.~
@1193 = ~Stop and smell the... Have you taken leave of your senses, <CHARNAME>? We stand on the edge of Resurrection Gorge! This is no time to stop and reflect on meaningless distractions!~ [OH76149]
@1194 = ~I fear this is the last time we shall have to reflect. ~
@1195 = ~Hah! I got you going, didn't I? You're right, of course. It's time we got this show on the road. Or in the gorge, as the case may be.~
@1196 = ~You are right, of course.~
@1197 = ~Cowardice ill-becomes you, <CHARNAME>.~ [OH76157]
@1198 = ~Don't mistake wisdom for cowardice, Dorn.~
@1199 = ~It becomes me better than death, I think. I've heard enough about the gorge to know it's a place I'd rather not visit.~
@1200 = ~Keep talking and you'll see how death becomes you, Dorn.~
@1201 = ~I thought I'd face my death in the gorge, not just outside it.~ [OH76161]
@1202 = ~Let's hope we won't face it at all, at least not any time soon. Yarrow, we would enter the gorge.~
@1203 = ~You won't face your death at all, today. We're leaving.~
@1204 = ~You face your death wherever and whenever you cross me, Dorn. Don't forget that.~
@1205 = ~I'll let my blade do my talking!~ [OH76165]
@1206 = ~So what do we do now? Would you have us turn our backs on the gorge after coming all this way, or finish what we began?~ [OH76166]
@1207 = ~Let's finish this. Yarrow, we want to enter the Gorge. Will you help us?~
@1208 = ~I've lost my appetite for this adventure. The gorge can wait for another day.~
@1209 = ~The only mistake I've made is taking you for a person of strength, <CHARNAME>.~ [OH76169]
@1210 = ~Your inability to see my strength is your weakness.~
@1211 = ~Let's hope that's the worst mistake you make today.~
@1212 = ~Would you like to feel my strength firsthand, Dorn?~
@1213 = ~I'd see your strength used to take the tanar'ri's sword.~ [OH76173]
@1214 = ~And you shall.~
@1215 = ~If that is your wish, I shall happily oblige!~ [OH76175]
@1216 = ~I see clearly, <CHARNAME>, which is more than can be said for you.~ [OH76176]
@1217 = ~This is an argument we can have another day. On this venture, time is not our ally.~
@1218 = ~At last! The moment is at hand!~ [OH76185]
@1219 = ~Wait. Something's not right here... The circle isn't complete. It's not complete!~ [OH76186]
@1220 = ~What's missing?~
@1221 = ~How is that possible?~
@1222 = ~The hag Azothet has betrayed us!~
@1223 = ~The circle should contain more summoning stones.~ [OH76190]
@1224 = ~They can't have gone far. Yarrow's let nothing escape the gorge since the demon broke free.~
@1225 = ~Looks like it's missing one, two... three of them.~
@1226 = ~It appears Azothet has led you astray.~
@1227 = ~Perhaps the corpse can tell us where to find them.~
@1228 = ~Curse me for a fool! Azothet betrayed me!~ [OH76195]
@1229 = ~Calm yourself, Dorn. There are other possibilities.~
@1230 = ~Curse me for a fool. I followed you into this place.~
@1231 = ~It certainly looks that way.~
@1232 = ~Such as?~ [OH76199]
@1233 = ~The gorge is far from empty. Any number of creatures could have purloined the stones.~
@1234 = ~Hrmm. You may be right.~ [OH76201]
@1235 = ~And if I am? If one or more of the inhabitants of the gorge have the missing stones?~
@1236 = ~You blame me for this?~ [OH76203]
@1237 = ~I blame no one but myself for the messes I get in.~
@1238 = ~I would if I didn't think doing so would earn me a sword through the gut.~
@1239 = ~Who else would I blame? Ur-Gothoz? Azothet? They didn't bid me join them on a fool's errand.~
@1240 = ~We'll get nowhere quarreling amongst ourselves. We must explore the gorge—find the missing stones.~ [OH76207]
@1241 = ~Agreed. It's not like leaving's an option at this point.~
@1242 = ~Nor did they bid you die on one, but die you shall!~ [OH76209]
@1243 = ~It's possible Azothet didn't deliberately send us to our doom.~ [OH76210]
@1244 = ~Anything's possible.~
@1245 = ~You choose a wise course.~ [OH76212]
@1246 = ~Better late than never.~
@1247 = ~I never trusted the crone... But there are other possibilities.~ [OH76214]
@1248 = ~Perhaps the tanar'ri took the stones to prevent itself from being forced back into the Abyss.~ [OH76215]
@1249 = ~Other creatures make their home in this vile pit. Maybe they can help us?~
@1250 = ~Either that, or some of the other things down here got hold of them.~
@1251 = ~That's what I'd do.~
@1252 = ~As would I.~ [OH76219]
@1253 = ~It appears we must find the tanar'ri.~
@1254 = ~We'll make them help us.~ [OH76221]
@1255 = ~Let's try asking them first.~
@1256 = ~If they refuse us, they will die.~
@1257 = ~Your understanding of the correct application of power is admirable.~ [OH76224]
@1258 = ~There's much to admire about me.~
@1259 = ~When you've got it, flaunt it over the heads of your enemies until they're lying in battered and bloody heaps.~
@1260 = ~As is yours. Let's introduce this pit to its new masters.~
@1261 = ~The stones must still be here somewhere.~ [OH76228]
@1262 = ~Yarrow would never let them leave.~
@1263 = ~Very well. We'll scour every inch of this gorge till we find the stones.~ [OH76230]
@1264 = ~We could just find the tanar'ri, kill it, and leave.~
@1265 = ~Sounds like fun.~
@1266 = ~An impossible task. There must be an easier way.~
@1267 = ~If you insist, we'll let them think they have a choice. But one way or another, I will have the answers I seek.~ [OH76234]
@1268 = ~It's not like we've any other option.~ [OH76235]
@1269 = ~What you say is true. And also terribly depressing. Well, let's get on with it, then.~
@1270 = ~Hah! I admire your spirit, <CHARNAME>. You make good company for one such as me.~ [OH76237]
@1271 = ~The gorge awaits.~
@1272 = ~And lose my chance to rid myself of Ur-Gothoz? No. We'll find the tanar'ri and take its stygian blade, to be sure. But only for use in the ritual.~ [OH76239]
@1273 = ~This fool's quest of yours will be both our ends.~
@1274 = ~Well said. I knew you'd see it my way.~
@1275 = ~I see it our way. Let's waste no more time in this place.~ [OH76242]
@1276 = ~You'll see how foolish my quest is when we've got the summoning stones and the abyssal blade.~ [OH76243]
@1277 = ~I can't wait. Let's go see what the gorge has to offer us.~
@1278 = ~I may be on a fool's quest, but your fool's tongue has sealed your doom!~ [OH76245]
@1279 = ~Your circle is incomplete, druid. Where are the summoning stones?~ [OH76250]
@1280 = ~I seek your missing summoning stones.~
@1281 = ~I'll get back to you on that.~
@1282 = ~If you wish to continue breathing, you'll tell me where to find the stones to complete your summoning circle.~
@1283 = ~Then return to the Hell from whence you came!~ [OH76267]
@1284 = ~Don't play games with me, druid. Where are the stones of summoning?~ [OH76273]
@1285 = ~You came here willingly, <CHARNAME>. No one put a sword to your throat.~ [OH76278]
@1286 = ~I came here willingly, and I'll leave the same way—the sooner, the better. Now, druid, where can we find the circle's stones?~
@1287 = ~I sort of wish someone had. Then I'd have an excuse.~
@1288 = ~I came here seeking power and fortune. Thus far, I've been disappointed.~
@1289 = ~I share your disappointment, but trust our current circumstances are but a fleeting setback. Now, druid—where are the summoning stones?~ [OH76284]
@1290 = ~He died.~ [OH76301]
@1291 = ~Obviously. But he might have done something between opening the portal and dying.~
@1292 = ~And what if he did? All that matters now is where we can find the stones.~ [OH76303]
@1293 = ~We'll find them faster if you let him finish his story. Go on, druid.~
@1294 = ~The Abyss take you both! Enough stories—tell us where we can find the stones!~ [OH76311]
@1295 = ~Tell us where we can find the stones, druid, or I'll return you to the Hell from whence you came!~ [OH76330]
@1296 = ~Dorn here is clearly another matter.~
@1297 = ~I weary of this druid. Come, <CHARNAME>. The sooner we collect the stones, the sooner we can be free of this place.~ [OH76365]
@1298 = ~The nereid's mind is broken. We've no time for this nonsense.~ [OH76378]
@1299 = ~She may yet be able to help us.~
@1300 = ~You're right. Perhaps she'll be more forthcoming some other time.~
@1301 = ~I'll gut you like a fish!~ [OH76386]
@1302 = ~Give us the stones, nereid.~ [OH76397]
@1303 = ~We've wasted enough time with this nereid's drivel. Where can we find the stones?~ [OH76398]
@1304 = ~Tell us where to find the stones, or I swear your stream will run warm and red with your blood!~ [OH76415]
@1305 = ~You'd better tell him, Winterbrook. You've suffered enough in this cursed place. I'd not see you endure more.~
@1306 = ~Do nereids bleed red?~
@1307 = ~Listen to the half-orc, nereid. My patience is at an end.~
@1308 = ~You should have given us the stones, nereid. You've brought this on yourself!~ [OH76422]
@1309 = ~In a moment, you'll have an answer!~ [OH76423]
@1310 = ~She mocks us, <CHARNAME>. You cannot allow this insolence to go unpunished.~ [OH76425]
@1311 = ~Nor shall I.~
@1312 = ~Finally!~ [OH76432]
@1313 = ~This discussion makes a mockery of our quest. Where is the stone, woman?~ [OH76441]
@1314 = ~What? I'm looking at her like I would anything else.~ [OH76462]
@1315 = ~Exactly. It's unnerving.~
@1316 = ~Well, where would you have me look?~ [OH76464]
@1317 = ~Elsewhere. Just let me talk to Winterbrook for a moment or two.~
@1318 = ~You'll have me closing my eyes next.~ [OH76466]
@1319 = ~Hopefully, it won't come to that. Winterbrook, you were telling us about the summoning stones?~
@1320 = ~Ice melts, blood dries, but steel is eternal!~ [OH76470]
@1321 = ~Servant?~ [OH76478]
@1322 = ~Please, Winterbrook. Without the stone, Resurrection Gorge is doomed.~
@1323 = ~I'll admit, any picture with Dorn in it will not be a portrait of the entirely trustworthy. But in this instance, I beseech you, for your and the sake of all who live in or near the gorge, please, give us the stone. ~
@1324 = ~What you believe is irrelevant. We need the stone. Give it to us or I'll let Dorn have his way with you.~
@1325 = ~Servant?!~ [OH88475]
@1326 = ~Have you lost your mind, <CHARNAME>? Are you truly going to argue with this madwoman over the preferences of an inanimate object?~ [OH76516]
@1327 = ~He's got a point, Winterbrook. We need the stone to save the gorge. Will you help us?~
@1328 = ~No. I'm done talking.~
@1329 = ~My blade grows uneasy in its sheath, <CHARNAME>. How much longer are we going to indulge this madwoman's lunacy?~ [OH76541]
@1330 = ~Please, Winterbrook. We need your help. Give us the stone.~
@1331 = ~No longer. My patience with you is at an end, nereid.~
@1332 = ~Curse you, <CHARNAME>!~ [OH76549]
@1333 = ~"Be reasonable"? You're pathetic, <CHARNAME>. ~ [OH76560]
@1334 = ~The nereid's suffered much, but I believe there's still a spark of her former self that might be willing to assist us.~
@1335 = ~I've been called worse by better than you, Dorn.~
@1336 = ~Say that again, Dorn. Say it again and see what reward it gets you.~
@1337 = ~You seriously believe this wretched creature offers anything but frustration, obfuscation, and distraction?~ [OH76565]
@1338 = ~Not really, no.~
@1339 = ~I believe she'll offer us what we want, one way or the other. Additionally, I'd like to say that the vocabulary book you picked up has really been making a difference.~
@1340 = ~Then why do you allow her to distract us from our goal?~ [OH76572]
@1341 = ~I had hoped she might aid us in reaching it.~
@1342 = ~Hope springs eternal in the <PRO_RACE> breast.~
@1343 = ~She'll distract us no longer.~
@1344 = ~You must know there can be no reasoning with this madwoman.~ [OH76576]
@1345 = ~That's no reason not to try.~
@1346 = ~You're right. Take your sword and talk some sense into her.~
@1347 = ~You're madder than she is if you think she'll willingly help us.~ [OH76579]
@1348 = ~I seek only to prevent unnecessary bloodshed—either hers or ours.~
@1349 = ~I am here in the shadows of Resurrection Gorge, so there's certainly an argument to be made that that's the case.~
@1350 = ~Willingly or not, she will help us. Won't you, Winterbrook?~
@1351 = ~Enough of this pointless nonsense! If she won't hand over the stone, I'll simply have to take it!~ [OH76583]
@1352 = ~"Unnecessary bloodshed"? What happened to you, <CHARNAME>? I believed you a being of strength and power, a worthy ally. Instead you play dither with fools.~ [OH76584]
@1353 = ~It was your infatuation with strength and power that brought us here, Dorn. I may share your fate, but I'll not repeat your mistakes.~
@1354 = ~You'll see your belief justified with blood, half-orc!~
@1355 = ~You're right, Dorn. But the dithering is done.~
@1356 = ~Keep talking, <PRO_RACE>, and you'll experience a wholly different fate, I promise you that.~ [OH76588]
@1357 = ~We'll deal with this another time. Winterbrook. The stone. We need it.~
@1358 = ~You'll not live to repeat the mistake you just made.~ [OH76590]
@1359 = ~You had your chance with <CHARNAME>, nereid. Now you'll see how Dorn Il-Khan deals with those who would stand 'twixt him and his goals.~ [OH76593]
@1360 = ~Fortunately, I've no such misgivings.~ [OH76609]
@1361 = ~A joke? You waste our time telling jokes to this pathetic witch?~ [OH76610]
@1362 = ~Better than me?~ [OH76615]
@1363 = ~I'll see your guts on the ground, <CHARNAME>.~ [OH76616]
@1364 = ~The stream can have my toes—I'll have your head!~ [OH76618]
@1365 = ~Faerie dragons. This will be aggravating.~ [OH76628]
@1366 = ~They're harmless.~
@1367 = ~Come on, they're cute. That one has a puffy tail!~
@1368 = ~You're right. Just looking at them gives me a headache.~
@1369 = ~Die, dragon!~ [OH76713]
@1370 = ~I'll strip the scales from your body, you featherless cockatiel!~ [OH76767]
@1371 = ~Cease your endless blathering, <CHARNAME>! We're not here to discuss creature comforts with a dragon! We need to find the summoning stones!~ [OH76787]
@1372 = ~We shall be rewarded for it.~ [OH76820]
@1373 = ~I hope you're right, Dorn. For both our sakes.~
@1374 = ~Your optimism is as impressive as it is inexplicable.~
@1375 = ~It better, Dorn. For your sake.~
@1376 = ~Your threats ring hollow in this place, <CHARNAME>. Let us do what we came here to do. If either of us are dissatisfied with the result, we can take the matter up then.~ [OH76824]
@1377 = ~Agreed. Dragon, what do you know of the stones?~
@1378 = ~You go too far, <PRO_RACE>. Here is your reward!~ [OH76826]
@1379 = ~What can you tell us of the summoning stones, dragon?~ [OH76827]
@1380 = ~I will prevail against whatever this foul pit throws at us, of that I am certain. Can you not say the same, <CHARNAME>?~ [OH76828]
@1381 = ~The only certainty I have is that I shall do my best to conquer the challenges ahead.~
@1382 = ~I can say many things, Dorn, but for now I'd rather listen to Fil tell us about the stones.~
@1383 = ~Your certainty is but a shadow of my own, Dorn. Nothing can thwart us, so long as we work together.~
@1384 = ~"I'll do my best"? Only cowards and failures talk like that. Which are you, <CHARNAME>? ~ [OH76832]
@1385 = ~Neither, at least not yet. But only a fool ignores the possibility of failure.~
@1386 = ~What you call cowardice and failure I call wisdom and survival, Dorn.~
@1387 = ~Draw your blade and find out, half-orc.~
@1388 = ~Hah! That's who I was looking for—someone worthy to share my victories.~ [OH76836]
@1389 = ~Your greatest victory is yet to come, Dorn. Dragon, tell us what you know of the stones.~
@1390 = ~The greater fool dwells upon it.~ [OH76838]
@1391 = ~We're neither of us fools. Dragon, do you know anything of the stones we seek?~
@1392 = ~You call me a fool?~ [OH76840]
@1393 = ~Your faltering rationalizations sicken me, <PRO_RACE>.~ [OH76841]
@1394 = ~No more than your pigheaded obstinacy sickens me, half-orc.~
@1395 = ~I have a cure for that particularly sickness. It's a bit radical, but you clearly have little use for your ears.~
@1396 = ~Keep talking, Bhaalspawn, and your sickness may come to an abrupt and bloody end.~ [OH76844]
@1397 = ~I look forward to it, Dorn. But if you're not of a mind to play surgeon now, let us attend to the matter at hand.~
@1398 = ~That's no business of this dragon's or anyone else.~ [OH76846]
@1399 = ~I'm sorry, Dorn, but I believe Fil here will respond best to forthrightness.~
@1400 = ~Your wings won't save you from my wrath, dragon!~ [OH76860]
@1401 = ~My blade will open him nose-tip to tail!~ [OH76861]
@1402 = ~That's rather a bleak philosophy, don't you think?~
@1403 = ~You try to extort Dorn Il-Khan? I'll have your skin for boots!~ [OH76866]
@1404 = ~Calm yourself, Dorn. It's only fair that we offer something in exchange for the stones.~
@1405 = ~Come, Dorn. There's barely enough skin there to cover even one of those massive hoofs you call feet.~
@1406 = ~Take it. This dragon's of no use to us. But a warning: I've heard faerie dragon skin is often rife with ticks.~
@1407 = ~Fair? You would speak to me of fair while this dragon tries to steal what's rightfully ours?~ [OH76870]
@1408 = ~You call my feet big?~ [OH76874]
@1409 = ~All the better to kick people to death with, granny.~
@1410 = ~I knew an old lady who lived in a shoe. That shoe couldn't contain your feet.~
@1411 = ~They're large and mighty, just like the rest of you.~
@1412 = ~You'll find out how big when they stomp you into a crimson paste!~ [OH76881]
@1413 = ~I've seen it happen, Fil, and to bigger creatures than you. Where are the stones?~
@1414 = ~You'll make a fine meal, dragon.~ [OH76892]
@1415 = ~If you attempt to cheat us, dragon, I promise you'll regret it.~ [OH76918]
@1416 = ~She said there would be some obstacles.~ [OH76921]
@1417 = ~If she hadn't promised you freedom from Ur-Gothoz, I'd say she was a mistress of understatement.~
@1418 = ~She got that right. I hope she got the bit about binding Ur-Gothoz right, too. Let's do this.~
@1419 = ~A fallen tree is an obstacle. Bargaining with a dragonfae is foolishness. She has turned us into fools, Dorn!~
@1420 = ~Let's find these crystals and get this over with.~ [OH76925]
@1421 = ~I'll tear your wings from your body, you reptilian vermin!~ [OH76946]
@1422 = ~Don't be a fool, <CHARNAME>. Give the dragon the crystals now and we'll never get the stone.~ [OH76963]
@1423 = ~I'll give you a Great and Magnificent death, you flapping rodent!~ [OH76992]
@1424 = ~You'll let this rodent live?~ [OH77004]
@1425 = ~Indulge your bloodlust with some other creature, Dorn. There's plenty here more worthy of your blade.~
@1426 = ~Oh, let the dragon go, Dorn. It's irritating, but it's harmless.~
@1427 = ~Yeah, now that I think about it, it doesn't really inspire, does it? Kill the dragon; let's see if that feels better.~
@1428 = ~I give you a swift death, you windy snake!~ [OH77016]
@1429 = ~But my sword will go right in!~ [OH77025]
@1430 = ~I'll see you dance at the end of my blade, demon!~ [OH77038]
@1431 = ~Then pay the price!~ [OH77045]
@1432 = ~Back to the Abyss with you, tanar'ri!~ [OH77051]
@1433 = ~If he has power to offer, why wouldn't I take it?~ [OH77057]
@1434 = ~Where do I begin?~
@1435 = ~Because you're not fool enough to take a demon at its word.~
@1436 = ~Do I really need to explain this to you? Are you truly that stupid?~
@1437 = ~Do us all a favor, and don't.~ [OH77061]
@1438 = ~What do you have to offer me?~ [OH77062]
@1439 = ~Dorn, no! You cannot trust a tanar'ri.~
@1440 = ~Seriously? You're ready to go through this all again?~
@1441 = ~Il-Khan, you weak-minded fool!~
@1442 = ~The abyssal blade! I need that sword if I'm to bind Ur-Gothoz to my will.~ [OH77067]
@1443 = ~You'll also need the missing summoning stones.~
@1444 = ~The tanar'ri tells it true. A demon's oath, once made, cannot be broken—not by the demon, at any rate.~ [OH77072]
@1445 = ~And you'll swear an oath? You'll give us the sword and all the summoning stones you possess?~
@1446 = ~You call me stupid, <CHARNAME>?~ [OH77075]
@1447 = ~I trust it not at all, but I would see what it has to offer.~ [OH77077]
@1448 = ~You bargained with another demon once, and look where it got you.~
@1449 = ~It got me the power I needed to slay my foes and triumph over all who would oppose me.~ [OH77079]
@1450 = ~You overstep your place, <PRO_RACE>.~ [OH77080]
@1451 = ~Only to bring you to your senses. You can't believe this demon means you anything but harm.~
@1452 = ~You overstep sanity, half-orc.~
@1453 = ~You dare to tell me my place? I'll stuff your tongue down your miserable throat!~
@1454 = ~You brought this on yourself!~ [OH77084]
@1455 = ~Wait, <CHARNAME>. I would hear what he has to say.~ [OH77096]
@1456 = ~Compliments mean nothing to me, demon. You said you had wealth to offer.~ [OH77098]
@1457 = ~And you listened to him.~
@1458 = ~<CHARNAME>, a word?~ [OH77102]
@1459 = ~I'll need his sword to perform the ritual.~ [OH77103]
@1460 = ~Xachrimos! We'll also need your sword.~
@1461 = ~Die, tanar'ri! Die, that I may have your power!~ [OH77116]
@1462 = ~How much gold?~ [OH77129]
@1463 = ~I like the sound of that.~ [OH77131]
@1464 = ~Just remember whose mouth the sound is coming from.~
@1465 = ~Use your head, Dorn. He plans to cheat us.~
@1466 = ~I'd like the sound of this demon's screams more.~
@1467 = ~What treachery is this?~ [OH77157]
@1468 = ~No one makes a fool of Dorn Il-Khan and lives!~ [OH77167]
@1469 = ~I'll bury your corpse under yon statue, you snake-tongued deceiver!~ [OH77168]
@1470 = ~Feel your own blade's kiss!~ [OH77173]
@1471 = ~The hell he does!~ [OH77175]
@1472 = ~We still have business in this hole, <CHARNAME>. Have you forgotten why we came here in the first place?~ [OH77188]
@1473 = ~Even if I did, I've got you here to remind me.~
@1474 = ~Begone, dryad. When we're ready to leave, we'll summon you.~ [OH77190]
@1475 = ~There's other rewards still to be found. Begone, dryad. Should we have need of you, we'll let you know.~ [OH77192]
@1476 = ~<CHARNAME>, a word.~ [OH77219]
@1477 = ~What is it, Dorn?~
@1478 = ~The ritual requires the sacrifice of a sapient being.~ [OH77221]
@1479 = ~It's too much, Dorn. I cannot allow it.~
@1480 = ~Fortunately, we can scrounge up a few sapient beings to sacrifice.~
@1481 = ~The druid who created the circle was revived. It is only fitting he die again, a victim of his own design.~
@1482 = ~We could resurrect the druid who created the circle. It would be amusing to see him die twice as a victim of his own design.~
@1483 = ~After all we've endured, you would deny me now?~ [OH77226]
@1484 = ~You want to sacrifice an innocent life! How can you not be concerned with that?~
@1485 = ~I would have denied you earlier, but there were scheduling conflicts. You know how it goes.~
@1486 = ~Only a fool would attempt to deny you anything, Dorn. And I am no fool.~
@1487 = ~A sapient life, not an innocent one—though it makes no difference to me either way. Nothing must stand between me and my goal.~ [OH77230]
@1488 = ~Not even me?~
@1489 = ~You have a way with words, Dorn—hammers have a similar way with anvils.~
@1490 = ~And nothing shall.~
@1491 = ~Help me on my quest or stand aside, <CHARNAME>, but do not test me on this.~ [OH77234]
@1492 = ~I'm afraid you leave me little choice.~
@1493 = ~I know how it will go if you attempt to bar my path.~ [OH77236]
@1494 = ~You leave me little choice, Dorn. I'll not allow you to slay one of my friends.~
@1495 = ~Not well for one of us, I suspect.~
@1496 = ~I have walked alongside you this far. I'll not stop now.~
@1497 = ~And you leave me with none.~ [OH77240]
@1498 = ~Die!~ [OH77241]
@1499 = ~Then die in their place!~ [OH77242]
@1500 = ~Then pay the price for your obstinacy!~ [OH77243]
@1501 = ~Then join all the others who stood in my way!~ [OH77244]
@1502 = ~Choose, <CHARNAME>. Will you stand with me or against me?~ [OH77245]
@1503 = ~I can't be with you, not in this.~
@1504 = ~Left to my own devices, I'd rather stand over there, out of arm's reach.~
@1505 = ~I'm with you, of course.~
@1506 = ~With me or against me. There are no other options.~ [OH77249]
@1507 = ~Then I'm against you. You leave me with little choice.~
@1508 = ~When you put it that way, I guess I'm with you.~
@1509 = ~I leave the pretty words to you, <PRO_RACE>. I've other things to consider.~ [OH77252]
@1510 = ~Let your friends bury you, <PRO_RACE>!~ [OH77253]
@1511 = ~Who would you see die that I might gain greater power?~ [OH77254]
@1512 = ~No one. This has gone far enough.~
@1513 = ~What if it were one of us?~
@1514 = ~If all that is required is a sapient creature... perhaps we could summon one and use it for our purposes.~
@1515 = ~What about Vernus?~
@1516 = ~That corpse could be handy.~
@1517 = ~You would refuse me?~ [OH77278]
@1518 = ~I must.~
@1519 = ~I don't want to, but yeah.~
@1520 = ~Of course not. We've sacrificed much to get you here; we cannot turn back now.~
@1521 = ~Yes... an excellent idea. Instruct one of them to enter the circle, but be sure not to reveal why. Then I need only write Ur-Gothoz's name in our sacrifice's blood, and his power shall be mine.~ [OH77282]
@1522 = ~Are you sure you want to write Ur-Gothoz's name?~
@1523 = ~There goes the neighborhood. If it were a better neighborhood, I may be a little worried.~
@1524 = ~With the glabrezu's power as your own, you'll be unstoppable.~
@1525 = ~Now, I need only write Ur-Gothoz's name in the druid's blood and the demon's power shall be mine.~ [OH77286]
@1526 = ~But is Ur-Gothoz's name the one you truly want to write?~
@1527 = ~There goes the neighborhood. If the neighborhood weren't in such dire repair, I'd be concerned.~
@1528 = ~It is time for the servant to become the master.~
@1529 = ~Still your tongue and help me perform the ritual.~ [OH77290]
@1530 = ~I cannot. I will not.~
@1531 = ~Still my tongue? Your loss...~
@1532 = ~As you wish. I'll place someone within the circle.~
@1533 = ~If not his, then whose?~ [OH77294]
@1534 = ~Clearly Azothet has power to rival Ur-Gothoz's own. Perhaps greater. Why not bind her to the sword?~
@1535 = ~You are right. You have lived under Ur-Gothoz's thumb for too long. It's time he pay for his treatment of you.~
@1536 = ~If I did such a thing, Ur-Gothoz would surely learn of it... and reward me.~ [OH77297]
@1537 = ~Sounds like a steal of a deal to me.~
@1538 = ~But you would still be bound as his servant.~
@1539 = ~Hrmm. This has become a... complex matter. I shall think upon it while you position someone within the circle.~ [OH77300]
@1540 = ~We could simply sacrifice one of these others.~ [OH92463]
@1541 = ~I have uses for them. And we have the ability to find another sapient.~
@1542 = ~Could. But won't.~
@1543 = ~You defy me, half-orc?~
@1544 = ~Very well. Let it be done.~ [OH92464]
@1545 = ~Such skittishness is beneath you, <CHARNAME>. But very well. We shall do as you suggest.~ [OH92465]
@1546 = ~I think you value these others more highly than they deserve. But if you would see them spared, so be it. We will do as you suggest.~ [OH92466]
@1547 = ~I have uses for them, and we have the ability to create another candidate.~
@1548 = ~We still need a sapient being within the circle before I can begin the ritual.~ [OH77301]
@1549 = ~Someone has entered the circle. Now let me draw the name upon the ground.~ [OH77306]
@1550 = ~Wait, let me think about this some more.~
@1551 = ~Dorn's bloody path

According to the druid Vernus, dragons hold one of the missing summoning stones, someone named Winterbrook another. Most are held by the tanar'ri. To free Dorn from Ur-Gothoz's service, we must collect them all.~
@1552 = ~Do it, summon forth Ur-Gothoz and free yourself!~
@1553 = ~Bring Azothet forth. Surely her powers trapped within a sword would be more valuable?~
@1554 = ~Decide. Quickly.~
@1555 = ~Whatever is necessary to gain the power I desire.~ [OH77409]
@1556 = ~Wait, Dorn. We can't sacrifice him.~
@1557 = ~That's the way the bough breaks sometimes. Sorry, druid.~
@1558 = ~You've died once already, druid. Perhaps that will make this easier for you.~
@1559 = ~I say we can.~ [OH77413]
@1560 = ~There must be another way.~
@1561 = ~Look at that face. How can you even think of killing something as cute as that?~
@1562 = ~For the life of me, I can't recall. Though I suppose it would be more accurate to say for the life of him.~
@1563 = ~Silence, druid!~ [OH77418]
@1564 = ~There is, of course.~ [OH77420]
@1565 = ~With ease.~ [OH77421]
@1566 = ~Not the time, <CHARNAME>!~
@1567 = ~No longer will I toil in service to your whims, Ur-Gothoz. All that you possess shall be mine!~ [OH77325]
@1568 = ~By all the gods in heaven and demons of the Abyss! The blade's power is...~ [OH77326]
@1569 = ~Magnificent?~
@1570 = ~More than a little disturbing.~
@1571 = ~Horrifying?~
@1572 = ~Yes, but it's not just the blade—something is amiss. My patron has been neutered, but my blackguard powers remain...~ [OH77330]
@1573 = ~Uh oh.~
@1574 = ~You say that like it's a bad thing.~
@1575 = ~Azothet! What is the meaning of this?~ [OH77334]

@1577 = ~Damn you, <CHARNAME>! Were you not here, this decision would be so easy.~ [OH77347]
@1578 = ~You are right on that score, <CHARNAME>.~ [OH77352]
@1579 = ~No! Marilith or no, I'll not be cowed into submission!~ [OH77353]
@1580 = ~What are you offering?~ [OH77360]
@1581 = ~Nothing she can offer is worth the freedom you'll lose.~
@1582 = ~Seriously? SERIOUSLY?~
@1583 = ~It better be a lot.~
@1584 = ~Back to the Abyss with you, marilith!~ [OH77364]
@1585 = ~You are right on that score, <CHARNAME>.~ [OH77352]
@1586 = ~But the power she offers is worth consideration. Now do as your new mistress commands.~
@1587 = ~I'm always right, Dorn. It's she who would enslave you that should feel your rage.~
@1588 = ~I've served Ur-Gothoz. Doing the same for Azothet could hardly be worse.~ [OH77372]
@1589 = ~If that's your wish, I'll not stand in your way.~
@1590 = ~You've gained a sword and lost your senses, Dorn. You can't seriously bend your knee to the likes of this.~
@1591 = ~I am yours to command, Azothet.~ [OH77376]
@1592 = ~In my wildest dreams, I never imagined I would wield such power as this.~ [OH77378]
@1593 = ~And what use will you put it to, Dorn?~
@1594 = ~Really? You need a better quality of wildest dream, my friend.~
@1595 = ~Then you must use it.~
@1596 = ~What do you mean?~ [OH77382]
@1597 = ~Ur-Gothoz no longer commands you. Your life is your own. My question is, what are you going to make of it?~
@1598 = ~Nothing. It just seemed like a suitably dramatic thing to say.~
@1599 = ~You've proven your worth to me, <CHARNAME>. Would that I could say the same for these others.~ [OH77385]
@1600 = ~What are you saying?~
@1601 = ~It is time, <CHARNAME>—past time, in fact—that we rid ourselves of these sycophants that cling to you like so many leeches.~ [OH77387]
@1602 = ~You call my friends leeches?~
@1603 = ~Well, this conversation's certainly taken an unpleasant turn.~
@1604 = ~They have their uses to me.~

@1606 = ~I won't allow that to happen.~
@1607 = ~What, all of them?~
@1608 = ~Very well then. Pick the one whose blood will bind us together for all time.~ [OH77395]
@1609 = ~Eternity beckons!~
@1610 = ~I call them what they are: parasites all.~ [OH77398]
@1611 = ~You can't expect me to do nothing while you malign my friends and allies, Dorn. Your new sword will be put to use sooner than you expected.~
@1612 = ~Your newfound power has blinded you, Dorn. These people are not without their uses.~
@1613 = ~Well—I suppose one would suffice.~ [OH77401]
@1614 = ~You've gained a sword and lost your mind, Dorn.~
@1615 = ~That's better. Much more reasonable.~
@1616 = ~You think I'd kill one of them for you? You overestimate your value to me, half-orc.~
@1617 = ~These worms weaken you, <CHARNAME>. They cannot be tolerated.~ [OH77405]
@1618 = ~Whatever I choose. With this ebon blade in my hand, nothing is beyond my power.~ [OH77406]
@1619 = ~With this blade in my hand, my dreams shall become reality.~ [OH77407]
@1620 = ~You thought to tempt me with Ur-Gothoz's power, witch. But taking yours suits me better.~ [OH77424]
@1621 = ~As my sword, you'll see a thousand thousand other deaths first!~ [OH77429]
@1622 = ~By all the gods in heaven and demons of the Abyss! I've never known such power! It's...~ [OH77437]
@1623 = ~In my wildest dreams, I never imagined I would wield such power as this.~ [OH77441]
@1624 = ~What do you mean?~ [OH77445]
@1625 = ~A blade that powerful is worthy of the epics. What are you going to do with that power?~
@1626 = ~Azothet's power flows fresh in the black metal. Use it now to strike Ur-Gothoz down!~
@1627 = ~A brilliant scheme, <CHARNAME>. Help me write his name in the circle while it retains its summoning power.~ [OH77449]
@1628 = ~It is beyond anything I've ever known.~ [OH77450]
@1629 = ~You need not fear the horrors to come, <CHARNAME>. You've proven your worth. Would that I could say the same for these others.~ [OH77451]
@1630 = ~It is time, <CHARNAME>—past time, in fact—that we rid ourselves of these sycophants that cling to you like so many leeches.~ [OH77453]
@1631 = ~You're drunk on power, Dorn. Get some sleep and we can discuss this in the morning when your head is clear.~
@1632 = ~To seal our unholy union, they must die.~ [OH77457]
@1633 = ~A pointless waste of valuable resources. One death should be sufficient to seal any unholy union.~
@1634 = ~Very well then. Pick the one whose blood will bind us together for all time.~ [OH77461]
@1635 = ~I call them what they are: parasites all.~ [OH77463]
@1636 = ~Your new found power has blinded you, Dorn. These people are not without their uses.~
@1637 = ~Well—I suppose one would suffice.~ [OH77466]
@1638 = ~Whatever purpose I see fit, of course.~ [OH77470]
@1639 = ~With this blade in my hand, my dreams shall become reality.~ [OH77471]
@1640 = ~Whatever I choose. With this ebon blade in my hand, nothing is beyond my power.~ [OH77472]
@1641 = ~You're wrong. It's only now, after all this time, that I finally see things clearly.~ [OH77473]
@1642 = ~My new friend shall explain for me!~ [OH77476]
@1643 = ~It is true, Ur-Gothoz. Azothet's power is now mine.~ [OH77482]
@1644 = ~I sought only to do as I believed you would wish.~ [OH77484]
@1645 = ~Thank you, Ur-Gothoz.~ [OH77486]
@1646 = ~Azothet is no more. She is bound in this sword; her power is now mine.~ [OH77488]
@1647 = ~Die in the name of Dorn Il-Khan!~ [OH90363]
@1648 = ~I offer you everything and you refuse? You've made a grave error, <CHARNAME>. Once, I might have let this insult pass, but no more. I'll take your Bhaalspawn power for myself, and we shall be together forever!~ [OH77490]
@1649 = ~I knew you were the one, <CHARNAME>—I knew it from the first moment I laid eyes upon you. Together we are as gods... The Abyss will tremble and the heavens fall before us!~ [OH77491]
@1650 = ~Shut up and kiss me, Dorn.~
@1651 = ~Is that it? And here I thought we'd be doing something impressive.~
@1652 = ~May the gods help those who stand against us. Nothing else will save them.~
@1653 = ~Freedom, at last... But the cost...~ [OH77495]
@1654 = ~One's freedom is a prize to be valued above all else.~
@1655 = ~I'd tell you to look on the bright side, Dorn... if I seriously believed you had one.~
@1656 = ~Count yourself lucky you didn't pay for it with your life.~
@1657 = ~Without a patron, my powers are diminished, but my options are greatly increased. And from now on, the blood I shed will be for my benefit and mine alone. ~ [OH77499]
@1658 = ~True enough... Though there's many who will pay for it with theirs.~ [OH77500]
@1659 = ~A wise one.~
@1660 = ~Speak for yourself, <CHARNAME>.~
@1661 = ~Where's the challenge in that?~
@1662 = ~It's only in being tested that we know our strength.~
@1663 = ~We can kill him now, right?~
@1664 = ~Keep your eyes to yourself, vampire. ~
@1665 = ~Do not play games with me. <CHARNAME> is mine.~
@1666 = ~I think she is something you will never possess while I live.~
@1667 = ~I'm sorry, Hexxat. Dorn and I share something special.~
@1668 = ~You presume too much, Dorn. ~
@1669 = ~Come now. Surely the three of us can reach an accommodation...~
@1670 = ~You would take this leech as a lover? So be it.~
@1671 = ~I'll enjoy seeing her drain your lifeblood and toss you aside for her next victim.~
@1672 = ~If you would be mine, <CHARNAME>, you must be mine alone.~
@1673 = ~I am nobody's, Dorn. Certainly not yours.~
@1674 = ~Then I am yours.~
@1675 = ~So you would rather the vampire? Pfah.~
@1676 = ~You'll rue the day you try to exchange me for a bear, <CHARNAME>.~
@1677 = ~Indeed. Vengeance is a worthy goal—let it focus your thoughts, sharpen them to a point you may then plunge into the hearts of your foes.~
@1678 = ~Ha. Yes, <CHARNAME> is good with the obvious.~
@1679 = ~You are no brother of mine. Keep your distance.~
@1680 = ~<CHARNAME>'s restraint has saved your life. You are fortunate <PRO_HESHE> was here to stay my hand.~
@1681 = ~Take the offer, <CHARNAME>. I like this woman's style.~
@1682 = ~How do you know of my involvement with the Shadow Thieves, or even that they are Shadow Thieves?~
@1683 = ~You know an awful lot about me. Where have you learned all of this?~
@1684 = ~It sounds like you've been spying on me. Why should I trust you?~
@1685 = ~Sweet deal, but what do you gain? I am no fool! What is it you will take from me?~
@1686 = ~I don't care about my "friend." I want Irenicus for revenge and for what he can do for me!~
@1687 = ~Some things are worth the risk, moonmaiden.~
@1688 = ~One of the greatest elven cities of the age, and it disappeared right in front of your eyes. Hah!~
@1689 = ~Hah! Prepare for the slaughter, Bodhi!~
@1690 = ~ 'Twould amuse me to hear her screams, but she might have more than entertainment value. I leave the decision to you.~
@1691 = ~What is this place you have brought us to, <CHARNAME>?~
@1692 = ~ 'Ware, <CHARNAME>! Something is amiss here.~
@1693 = ~Haha! Now this is a battle I can get behind!~
@1694 = ~Leave the brat behind. ~
@1695 = ~<CHARNAME>... I would have words with you. ~
@1696 = ~Will this end in another tantrum? ~
@1697 = ~Of course. After all, you've shown excellent self-control.~
@1698 = ~What's this? An assasination attempt after a failed public brawl? ~
@1699 = ~Calm yourself. I wished to assure you my attack on you last time will not happen again. I admit I... misjudged the situation. ~
@1700 = ~Misjudged the situation? That's it? ~
@1701 = ~Is this an apology? Good, I like this new humble you. ~
@1702 = ~You're insane. You think you can get away with few poorly put together words after that stunt?~
@1703 = ~Fine. Take what I said as an apology then. But understand <CHARNAME>, only mutual respect ensures loyalty in the end. Take care you give it when necessary. ~
@1704 = ~I always respected you Dorn. ~
@1705 = ~I wont be held accountable for your imagined lack of respect. ~
@1706 = ~Very well, but there needs to be some trust between us. ~
@1707 = ~You can be truly insufferable.~
@1708 = ~You have my respect <CHARNAME>. If we clash again in the future, it will not be because I wished it so.~
@1709 = ~I suggest you take me seriously <PRO_RACE>. ~
@1710 = ~Trust needs to be carefully handled, since it usually ends in demise of the fools who give it away freely. ~
@1711 = ~<CHARNAME>, I grow impatient. How long will we stumble around in circles, before you decide to manage some relevant business? ~
@1712 = ~Huh? What are you going on about? ~
@1713 = ~I see. Your patron does not approve, is that it? ~
@1714 = ~Oh? Is whining a part of your being intrigued with me bussiness? ~
@1715 = ~Stop feigning ignorance, you know very well what I mean! ~
@1716 = ~No. I have no idea where this is coming from. ~
@1717 = ~I'm not sure what is your problem or if I care, to be honest. ~
@1718 = ~I'm all out of divination spells today, Dorn, so you're going to have to speak plainly. ~
@1719 = ~I'm warning you, reconsider your choices or I will reconsider the potential I thought I saw in you.~
@1720 = ~I think my choices don't have anything to do with this tantrum. ~
@1721 = ~I'm rapidly losing interest in this conversation. Speak clearly or leave me be. ~
@1722 = ~I have means to make you care, <PRO_RACE>.~
@1723 = ~Enough of this pointless prattle! Just leave me be. ~
@1724 = ~You need attention or what? I don't understand.~
@1725 = ~You take risks by ovesleeping like that, <CHARNAME>. But, I'll admit you handled yourself quite well last night. I believe our exertions left us both very much satified?~
@1726 = ~It wasn't too bad, although next time you might find the tables turned.~
@1727 = ~It's a small miracle I can still walk. You exhausted me!~
@1728 = ~Definitely. I believe I will require a repeated performance. Many times over.~
@1729 = ~Ha! You play coy but we both know you're no innocent. Or are that pangs of guilt speaking?~
@1730 = ~Very good. I appreciate a <PRO_MANWOMAN> who knows where <PRO_HISHER> pleasure lies.~
@1731 = ~Indeed? Somehow I doubt that, but you're welcome to try.~
@1732 = ~In any case, we might have to do this again soon, <CHARNAME>.~
@1733 = ~Don't think I don't see you <CHARNAME>. Having second thoughts? Or is there something else on your mind?~
@1734 = ~It it only common sense to have second thoughts when about to speak with you.~
@1735 = ~Way too late for second thoughts now I'd say. But I was wondering about you.~
@1736 = ~We are past second thoughts, Dorn. It strikes  me I do not know that much about you, and one should always be informed.~
@1737 = ~Wondering about me, are you? Why? You know enough already, what matters more are the things at stake right now.~
@1738 = ~Is it so harmful? Relax Dorn, I'm not trying anything sinister. For now.~
@1739 = ~We are companions, more talking simply comes naturally.~
@1740 = ~Stop pretending, you know what I mean. Talk with me, Dorn.~
@1741 = ~It is a risky, and foolish move in the end.~
@1742 = ~Perhaps, but I would not ask this of just anyone. You know that.~
@1743 = ~We've became more than companions, have we not? I'm willing to risk, since I am letting you closer anyway.~
@1744 = ~So you intend to keep silent forever? I'm just asking to talk with you.~
@1745 = ~What you suggest usually means showing vulnerabilities, and that might end badly in the long run, <CHARNAME>.~
@1746 = ~That much is true, yes.~
@1747 = ~Very well, perhaps you deserve some indulgence.~
@1748 = ~Let us speak then, if that is your wish. Come, walk with me.~
@1749 = ~Have I ever told you about my early days in the tribe?~
@1750 = ~You never talked about your early days. I'm interested if you're willing to talk.~
@1751 = ~No, you never did. It was some northern orc tribe, I presume?~
@1752 = ~I don't have time for this now. Maybe later.~
@1753 = ~You asked for this, so you will listen. Now.~
@1754 = ~I was born in the Spine of the World to a human mother and orc father, a leader of his tribe. Weakness was not tolerated, and my mixed blood was seen as such. That said, I was not the only half-breed there.~
@1755 = ~I had to compete twice as hard, and take twice as much punishment to earn the same amount of recognition as the pure blooded peers. Fortunately, the rigorous conditions left no choice but to develop strength and resolution.~
@1756 = ~My father never paid too much attention to me, at least not until I started to show some physical prowess, but I was usually beyond concern.~
@1757 = ~Meanwhile, my mother was weak, always cowing, never taking the initiative. Her foolish attempts to coddle me ilicited a harsh response from the rest of the tribe.~
@1758 = ~Life as a nomad wasn't very varied, and the days mostly consisted of moving from place to place, survival, occasional raid, skirmish and trade.~
@1759 = ~Conditions were far from easy, but I grew resilient and determined. In time I might have taken one of the leading roles.~
@1761 = ~It's of no consequence anyway. The tribe was raided by ogres and my human mother and I escaped to Luskan. There I discovered the nature of the so called civilized men.~
@1762 = ~It is amusing how scarcely are they better than those they call savages. I believe you know the rest of story from there on.~
@1763 = ~I see. Harsh environment made you stronger. What became of your mother?~
@1764 = ~You learned how life works very early on, I see. Good for you.~
@1765 = ~Indeed. Last I saw of my mother, she was ingratiating herself to an officer in Luskan, so I left her to her own devices. Bottom line is, I do not care much for my supposed family or some long dead tribe.~
@1766 = ~I do not share this usually, but it was good talking about it. Until later <CHARNAME>.~
@1767 = ~What is it, <CHARNAME>?~
@1768 = ~I was just wondering about those peasants in the last tavern.~
@1769 = ~Are you alright? Those idiots in last tavern I mean.~
@1770 = ~People tend to have strong reactions around you, don't they?~
@1771 = ~Why would you even bother noticing a few cowardly peasant too afraid to do anything but murmur between themselves?~
@1772 = ~So you've noticed.~
@1773 = ~Why act surprised? It is well known fact half-breeds usually have a hard time in any society consisting of pure-bloods. Fortunately, I can take care of halfwits daring to cross my path.~
@1774 = ~And how exactly do you take care of them?~
@1775 = ~What have you dealt with, besides occasional tavern brawl?~
@1776 = ~Is that so hard to conclude?~
@1777 = ~But to sate your curiosity, let's say people do not consider orcs the sharpest tool in the shed. Mostly they are correct. They usually also apply the same criteria to half-orcs, although that is far less accurate.~
@1778 = ~By the same token, many human, elves, dwarves and such, think they are above and beyond the lowly half-orc, trying to take advantage. Imagine their surprise when they found the tables turned, or even better, a blade between their ribs.~
@1779 = ~When I first arrived in Luskan, I was used and cheated. I adapted.~
@1780 = ~After living with the tribe, it took time to play my heritage and intelligence to my advantage.~
@1781 = ~What can you tell me about Luskan?~
@1782 = ~By common knowledge, the city was built on ruins of Illusk, ancient orcish city. It is ruled by High Captains and Arcane Brotherhood, true power behind the throne.~
@1783 = ~Aside from that, nothing you couldn't learn from observing any other major city anywhere.~
@1784 = ~Rich and powerful vying for contol and stomping over those beneath them. Greed and lust hiding behind cowardice, hypocritical, mindless masses thirsting for blood, people trying to take advantage of each other at all times.~
@1785 = ~That is the civilization. You either learn to swim or you drown.~
@1786 = ~What about the Spine of the World?  It sounds intriguing.~
@1787 = ~If anything, I bet Spine of the World has plenty of sights and hidden riches.~
@1788 = ~Ah, yes. Frozen wastes of Icewind Dale, vast and unfathomable, hold many mysteries. One can never be sure what ancient secret might be stumbled upon by chance.~
@1789 = ~I've been able to plunder a few monasteries and ruins there, as well as slaughter some impressive beasts. The climate and inhabitants are different and harsher than South, but the sights can be impressive.~
@1790 = ~Much of the land is covered in eternal snow, always shifting but unchanging. Amidst all the ice, even time seems to come to a still. It can test your potential to the very limits.~
@1791 = ~There is savage beauty to be fond there.~
@1792 = ~You make it sound truly impressive. Perhaps we could go there someday.~
@1793 = ~I didn't know you are such a poet, Dorn. It's almost... disconcerting.~
@1794 = ~No need to rush. There are plenty of deadly places here, <CHARNAME>.~
@1795 = ~Very amusing, <CHARNAME>. But yes, keeping surprises in store has advantages.~
@1796 = ~I shared much of my past, now it is your turn. Tell me of that Gorion of yours. You don't mention him much.~
@1797 = ~Gorion was a Harper agent. I despised being under his constant supervision.~
@1798 = ~Gorion. He was a family I suppose, much like Imoen. I never cared much for him.~
@1799 = ~Gorion was a father where I had none. I sorely miss him.~
@1800 = ~I'm surprised to hear such sentiment from you <CHARNAME>. You still might have some growing up to do.~
@1801 = ~What about your mother? I suppose you never met her?~
@1802 = ~When giving birth to a child of Bhaal, mothers usually die.~
@1803 = ~I didn't. Died giving birth to me, apparently she was Gorion's lover, but I do not know much else.~
@1804 = ~She died giving birth to me.~
@1805 = ~So, you never had your true parents raise you, only your foster father, a bunch of dried up monks and that insipid pink nuisance for a company. How does that make you feel? Do you have any regrets?~
@1806 = ~Is speaking like this some sort of amusement for you, Dorn? Get lost!~
@1807 = ~I don't miss what I never had. At least I got education and some safety in the early years.~
@1808 = ~I don't care in the slightest. The past is behind me and my destiny is my sole focus now.~
@1809 = ~Gorion's lover somehow got pregnant with Bhaal? Curious.~
@1811 = ~So I struck a nerve. I hope you sort out your weakness before it sorts itself for you.~
@1812 = ~Very good attitude. The past is past, the future is what matters.~
@1813 = ~Setting into the world you reached for more than you could have been had you lived your life closeted in the dusty library of Candlekeep. I suspect that would not be possible had Gorion still lived.~
@1814 = ~I agree. No doubt he would try to hold me back with his teachings.~
@1815 = ~Actually, I think he might be actively try to stop me.~
@1816 = ~That is the core of the matter, <CHARNAME>. Many others will try to hold you back with their simplistic notions of morality, forcing their narrow views of right or wrong.~
@1817 = ~What matters is the goal and only those willing to make sacrifices attain it.~
@1818 = ~It is good to see you have set your path and posess determination to follow it.~
@1819 = ~There is something on my mind for a while now. I have a question for you <CHARNAME>.~
@1820 = ~I've had it with your blathering about, Dorn. Your questions don't matter, so silence yourself.~
@1821 = ~A question? You are getting quite talkative. I like it.~
@1822 = ~Spit it out, you have my attention.~
@1823 = ~I will let this one insult slide, since I am in the generous mood, fool, but you may consider your wish fulfilled.~
@1824 = ~I'm not doing it for your benefit.~
@1825 = ~You are aware of my opinion on how the matters should be dealt with, yet you produce results doing things quite differently. How would you describe your methods?~
@1826 = ~Strict grip on situation, long term planing and methodical thinking produce the greatest benefit in the end.~
@1827 = ~I've been called erratic in the past, but the passion is the key to strength and success.~
@1828 = ~Adaptation is a must. My needs and goals are my primary concern, and whatever tools required, should be used.~
@1829 = ~Yes, I've noticed your systhematic approach. It takes time and patience, but I'll admit I find your subversions thrilling.~
@1830 = ~Indeed. I understand the art of letting your urges take the control. Passion is vital to life.~
@1831 = ~I understand. Your ability to adapt has managed to let you get the most out of any situation. It is admirable.~
@1832 = ~So you believe in order? Is ruthlessness and ambition the way you operate?~
@1833 = ~Yes, hidden blades work best. The capable can exploit the systems to their own ends and I will make them bend to my will.~
@1834 = ~I do. Results demand focus and my enemies will not see me coming, before it is way too late.~
@1835 = ~So you do not think and analyze? You let the heat of the moment take you and let the chaos take it's course?~
@1836 = ~Yes. Only chaos offers the truth. Entropy will swallow everything in it's path and I will be it's agent.~
@1837 = ~Absolute freedom is thrilling. It enables the strong to thrive and take what they desire.~
@1838 = ~So you do not concern yourself with freedom or rules? You simply do what needs to be done, never taking sides?~
@1839 = ~Yes. The order or chaos do not matter to me. Only whatever suits my needs matters.~
@1840 = ~No one method will always work. Only by active balance and varied approach can one come out on top in the end.~
@1841 = ~Your actions are cunning, slick and charismatic. You hold back, control, manipulate and crush. I believe I understand the benefits you describe.~
@1842 = ~You are passionate, dangerous and unpredictable. It makes you a storm that no enemy can resist. It cannot be denied.~
@1843 = ~You walk on the edge, free from the pull of the extremes and unburdened by their demands. Subtle and blunt at the same time. It is interesting.~
@1844 = ~You make compelling argument, but if anything, it simply proves that there are many roads to realizing one's potential.~
@1845 = ~I know what worked for me so far, and I never concerned myself much with the nature of the tools used.~
@1846 = ~And what exactly works for you, Dorn?~
@1847 = ~Maybe it is time to reexamine and improve your methods.~
@1848 = ~Like any other force to be reckoned with, I do as I please.~
@1849 = ~But?~
@1850 = ~I made some... less adequate decisions. By brute force alone, I led myself into a corner, and that must not be allowed again.~
@1851 = ~So you seek to improve upon your, less adequate decisions.~
@1852 = ~Yes, some caution would serve you well.~
@1853 = ~I crave power and I want my lust satiated. ~
@1854 = ~That will not change. It is only the question of how it should be achieved.~
@1855 = ~It seems this matter requires more consideration.~
@1856 = ~There is also a matter of what power actually is.~
@1857 = ~You should also consider what the power will be used for.~
@1858 = ~What do you mean?~
@1859 = ~Well, idea of power is different for different people. Keep both effort and aim in mind, but also consider having a plan for the moment you achieve that power, so you don't lose your grip on it.~
@1860 = ~Interesting insight, <CHARNAME>. I concede your point, although you also have much to learn yet.~
@1861 = ~Let me guess, you want to be the one who will teach me.~
@1862 = ~You propose an exchange of knowlegde?~
@1863 = ~And why not? We are both capable, despite some of our differences.~
@1864 = ~Besides, our relationship has proven to be fruitful so far.~
@1865 = ~I'm still undecided. You will need to convince me... harder.~
@1866 = ~Fruitful indeed. And soon ripe for the taking. If you catch my drift.~
@1867 = ~I'm willing to give you some credit. We shall see.~
@1868 = ~You may tease, but you know I'm right. <CHARNAME>, I also strongly suggest you keep these conversations between us only.~
@1869 = ~Do you find me intimidating, <CHARNAME>?~
@1870 = ~Yes. But only in a sense that sometimes even Wild magic gives more predictable results than a conversation with you.~
@1871 = ~At the very least, one undoubtedly needs to be careful around you, Dorn.~
@1872 = ~No. You will be dealt with if neccessary, although I'd rather not see this happen.~
@1873 = ~I don't buy or appreciate your act, Dorn. You have many other qualities that I prefer.~
@1874 = ~Ha! Good point. It is only reasonable you should be on your toes a bit.~
@1875 = ~Ha! They say there is a thin line between the foolish and the brave. Think about it.~
@1876 = ~After all, I'm aware of the effect I have on others. My skills do merit such reactions, wouldn't you agree?~
@1877 = ~Well, you are many thing but above all- dangerous.~
@1878 = ~That much is true. Weak should cower before the strong.~
@1879 = ~Physical intimidation is for amateurs. I prefer your will and charisma.~
@1880 = ~Yes. But will and personality complement the physical prowess.~
@1881 = ~That is understandable. But you cannot completely divorce physical from mental.~
@1882 = ~What I'm saying is that you might want to consider all of the elements composing the bigger picture. That includes everybody and everything you deal with.~
@1883 = ~I never saw this side of you. Why exactly are you telling me this?~
@1884 = ~Unexpected advice, coming from you.~
@1885 = ~Your reaction only shows I was right when I said you have much to learn.~
@1886 = ~It's interesting to see what do you make of me after all this time. Whether we want it or not, we are coming closer, which opens some questions.~
@1887 = ~The most pressing being the issue of commitment to your, now our, cause. I am becoming a part of your path, I need reassurance you see me as a partner.~
@1888 = ~You are aware by now I despise betrayal, <CHARNAME>. For this matter, I'm simply asking that you give your word that we are partners, meant to see this through the end.~
@1889 = ~You have my word, Dorn, for what it's worth. You are more than just a tool.~
@1890 = ~Are you trying to manipulate your way into my good stead? Because if so, this pathetic attempt is hilarious.~
@1891 = ~I see. You're a greater fool than you'll ever know, but so be it. We are through.~
@1892 = ~And you have mine, this I promise.~
@1893 = ~While only actions matter in the end, it pleases me that we at least stated our intentions openly.~
@1894 = ~I have been thinking back to our conversation about the methods and the goal.~
@1895 = ~I remember. You were curious whether I lean toward subtlety or bluntness.~
@1896 = ~I have no idea what you are talking about. Not wearing helmet into battle was a bad idea, I knew it.~
@1897 = ~You mean order versus chaos, right? You know my answer already.~
@1898 = ~This won't turn into another lecture, I hope?~
@1899 = ~Shall we test if your dull wit is an adequate protection instead?~
@1900 = ~Insolence. Not a refreshing perspective from you.~
@1901 = ~Your answers required consideration, on the merit they brought us a long way so far.~
@1902 = ~It almost sounds like you would listen to my advice.~
@1903 = ~Does that mean there is a conclusion?~
@1904 = ~I'm glad to see you thought about it.~
@1905 = ~Yes, almost. I concluded there might be gain in focusing myself more. On the other hand it seems like a bother, when my present methods seem to be satisfying enough.~
@1906 = ~Truly? Haven't you already said you make some, less adequate decisions, as you call them?~
@1907 = ~Do whatever pleases you. You should be capable of assessing the situation and make your own choice in the end.~
@1908 = ~It is not a choice to be made lightly in any case.~
@1909 = ~You know my opinion. Structure is important.~
@1910 = ~You know my opinion. Freedom is paramount.~
@1911 = ~You know my opinion. Balance is crucial.~
@1912 = ~You may be right. I might benefit from using the constrains to my advantage and more subtle tools of power.~
@1913 = ~I trust it will lead you to greater heights.~
@1914 = ~You may be right. I might benefit from letting my desires guide my path.~
@1915 = ~You may be right. I might benefit from adapting to a situation as is required.~
@1916 = ~I believe it will. Relative stability will offer room for some interesting opportunities.~
@1917 = ~I believe it will. I find passion and force to be excellent motivators.~
@1918 = ~I believe it will. There should be much less room for setbacks and surprises now.~
@1919 = ~It will probaly take time to fully adapt to new concepts but it seems I have chosen my course for now.~
@1920 = ~That you did.~
@1921 = ~Whatever you say. No skin off my back.~
@1922 = ~I like what I'm seeing. Even more than usual, I mean.~
@1923 = ~I am pleased. Very pleased. There is an excitement in this future potential alone. Do you feel it? I desire you, <CHARNAME>, let us celebrate by bringing this to a proper climax.~
@1924 = ~Dorn! This is not the time or place for this!~
@1925 = ~I'm game if you are.~
@1926 = ~Sounds like my kind of reward, but let's wait until later.~
@1927 = ~Come here. Do you feel this? It's for you.~
@1928 = ~You are impossible!~
@1929 = ~My, how interesting. We should explore it further.~
@1930 = ~Release me this instant!~
@1931 = ~Ha! Look at you squirm! Don't worry, <CHARNAME>, everything in it's due course. At least now you have something to look forward to tonight.~
@1932 = ~For now you should be at ease, knowing that with me by your side, success is imminent. We have an understanding and I tru...~
@1933 = ~Dorn?~
@1934 = ~I... No, it is nothing.~
@1935 = ~I said it's nothing! Let us just continue on.~
@1936 = ~What were you about to say?~
@1937 = ~I'm not in the mood to talk. Stop tempting my ire with your blundering attempts to instigate conversation, <PRO_RACE>.~
@1938 = ~Hearing threats from you is certainly refreshing.~
@1939 = ~Sulking like a spoiled brat won't solve anything, Dorn.~
@1940 = ~Your foul moods are of no concern to me, half-orc.~
@1941 = ~Are you deaf? I said to leave me alone.~
@1942 = ~I'm waiting.~
@1943 = ~I won't go anywhere.~
@1944 = ~What in the Abyss do you want from me? I've nothing to say!~
@1945 = ~Do I look stupid? You're bothered by something. Let's hear it.~
@1946 = ~Brooding won't solve anything. You claim we are partners. Speak.~
@1947 = ~I will not be treated like this. I will have answers.~
@1948 = ~If I decide to speak, <CHARNAME>, it shall be when I'm ready.~
@1949 = ~Now leave, I need time to think.~
@1950 = ~I'm ready to talk now, <CHARNAME>. Will you listen?~
@1951 = ~Finally decided to speak. Say your peace then.~
@1952 = ~I'm not sure whether I care anymore.~
@1953 = ~Very well. This better be worth all that brooding about.~
@1954 = ~Be patient and listen, this is important.~
@1955 = ~I thought much about our partnership and how we gave our word to see this through together.~
@1956 = ~But what I realized is that your effect on me was greater than I had thought, and it is worrisome. It is weak of me to let myself be influenced in such a manner.~
@1957 = ~I should be wary. I will not allow you to be my or our downfall in the end.~
@1958 = ~You cannot be serious. You're basically accusing me of talking to you.~
@1959 = ~You're delusional. People influence each other all the time.~
@1960 = ~Why is that bad? You said yourself change felt good.~
@1961 = ~I'm not talking only about our philosophical sparring. What bothers me most is something else.~
@1962 = ~It is the fact that you slowly managed to make me tolerate things from you, that I would not tolerate from others.~
@1963 = ~Remember when I asked you if you find me intimidating? Your answer didn't truly matter, because at that point you weren't in danger from me anymore.~
@1964 = ~There must be boundaries and I allowed you to cross them. This must not stand.~
@1965 = ~Dorn, this goes both ways. I gave my word, remember?~
@1966 = ~I have also let myself be affected by cooperating with you, Dorn!~
@1967 = ~You drove me to submit myself! Inexcusable!~
@1968 = ~I did no such thing! You accepted my advice of your own volition!~
@1969 = ~Cooperation is not submission!~
@1970 = ~As if you know what you're talking about!~
@1971 = ~What is the solution to this problem then? You act like your abundance of opinions makes you wiser than the rest of the fools who have them.~
@1972 = ~Calm down. What you describe are normal parts of any relationship.~
@1973 = ~I expected you to have stronger will than this. Learning is not a defeat.~
@1974 = ~You are making the problem out of having a bond. It seems to me something else is the problem here. Again.~
@1975 = ~You truly expexted to be completely uninfluenced by forming an intimate relationship?~
@1976 = ~Hah! An expected answer. I do not know why I even listen to you.~
@1977 = ~Because you know I'm right.~
@1978 = ~You expect to have close relation and be distant at the same time.~
@1979 = ~You will need to start thinking clearly and decide what you want.~
@1980 = ~That is easy for you to say.~
@1981 = ~Dorn, I've proven my intentions and gave my word. You will need to decide.~
@1982 = ~I thought you appreciate simple solutions. My actions so far have made my point clear for me.~
@1983 = ~...~
@1984 = ~Very well.~
@1985 = ~I will accept your reasoning. Again. It looks like we went too far anyway.~
@1986 = ~The stakes just got higher. You better appreciate this concession I made for you.~
@1987 = ~I do and I'm glad. We make too good a pair to simply throw it away.~
@1988 = ~That I do. I need you ready for the trials ahead.~
@1989 = ~Yes, well, nothing to say about it anymore. Let's see what the road ahead holds.~
@1990 = ~Stopping, are we? I hope you do not have any plans for tonight, <CHARNAME>.~
@1991 = ~Oh? And what if I do?~
@1992 = ~Because you already made them for me, I presume.~
@1993 = ~Are you proposing something?~
@1994 = ~I have something in mind for us. And I trust you will like it.~
@1995 = ~You have my attention, I think.~
@1996 = ~Hm, I'm not easy to please, as you know.~
@1997 = ~I know. <CHARNAME>, I desire you, and I've missed your passion. I want to please you as well as you please me.~
@1998 = ~I'm definitely not complaining.~
@1999 = ~The question is whether you deserve this? You have been a litle difficult after all.~
@2000 = ~Consider our little talks as an extra spice, that might result in some interesting benefits. Even in matters such as these.~
@2001 = ~Intriguing. But you had me at "plans tonight".~
@2002 = ~Very well, we will see. I look forward to it.~
@2003 = ~Patience. I believe we will enjoy our leisure time ahead to the fullest.~
@2004 = ~Good. As you will see, I may have prepared a bit more than just a bedroll.~
@2005 = ~Right. Now I'm really curious.~
@2006 = ~But it is a liberating thought at the same time. When biased opinions of others do not matter, we are able to do as we please.~
@2007 = ~Indeed we are. We carve our own path.~
@2008 = ~An exciting thought. I just wonder whether we have much else in common.~
@2009 = ~I agree. You should rule your heritage, not the opposite.~
@2010 = ~That we do. One thing at a time.~
@2011 = ~We do more than you think. Time will continue to prove you this.~
@2012 = ~Wise words. I'm glad you understand this truth.~
@2013 = ~We are far along our path, <CHARNAME>.~
@2014 = ~Yes, I believe we are nearing our goal.~
@2015 = ~I suspect we still have some way ahead of us.~
@2016 = ~We are far enough for me to warrant saying a few words. Listen to me carefully.~
@2017 = ~Are you brewing another conflict? Let's hear it.~
@2018 = ~I think I see where this is heading. Speak, I'm listening.~
@2019 = ~Enough. I've had it with your constant strife. Shut up and get lost.~
@2020 = ~I see my efforts were wasted on your idiocy. <CHARNAME>, we are done!~
@2021 = ~Once you asked me if I was willing to bend to make this between us work. I was not.~
@2022 = ~You still managed to influence me to a greater degree that I would ever thought possible. I'm not an impressionable peasant, but I relied on your advice, and you stood by me through many trials and difficult battles. For that, I am grateful.~
@2023 = ~Good. You should be.~
@2024 = ~Not everything was easy but we made it through.~
@2025 = ~Of course, I did the same thing for you. Which brings me to my next point.~
@2026 = ~We have proven time and time again, that our added skills are enhanced, not diminished. Together we are stronger, even if you are starting to surpass me, which I do not admit lightly. Through all of this I realized.~
@2027 = ~I trust you. Even more, I want to.~
@2028 = ~From the first moment I laid eyes upon you I knew there was something different. At first I thought I simply lust after your power. Later I realized I lust after you.~
@2029 = ~It is not just lust. You are truly unique, I admire you and I... care for you.~
@2030 = ~I don't know what to say, Dorn. Just that I care deeply for you too.~
@2031 = ~I'm pleased to see you've come around. Know that I share your feelings, Dorn.~
@2032 = ~Quite the confession. I never thought you had it in you.~
@2033 = ~It took time to admit this to myself and now to you. You had my loyalty, <CHARNAME>, and now you have even more. I would lay down my life for you.~
@2034 = ~That is good to know. It goes both ways.~
@2035 = ~I will take your word for it.~
@2036 = ~Indeed. We have long exceeded bonds of a simple partnership. Know that I will be at your side, as your champion, protector and lover.~
@2037 = ~Tell me, why did you accept my company in the end?~
@2038 = ~You are intiguing and very attractive in a rugged sort of way. That, and your skills.~
@2039 = ~Well, no one else suitable was around, so you had to do.~
@2040 = ~I believe you are an all-around worthy mate.~
@2041 = ~You flatter, but your reasons are your own in the end.~
@2042 = ~You once said power means different things to different people. I agree.~
@2043 = ~And it just took scouring almost all of Amn.~
@2044 = ~Good. I suppose I know your answer.~
@2045 = ~You aren't doing it justice. It took scouring Spine of the World and Baldur's gate also.~
@2046 = ~You know me, <CHARNAME>. I love things I'm good at: battle, strength, sex. I have no doubt we will achieve our goals, and then...~
@2047 = ~Yes?~
@2048 = ~New enemies and sights will arise and at one time or another, someone might stop me, or us. That will be a deserved rest, but until then I want to experience and conquer what I desire.~
@2049 = ~True enough. What about the finer qualities of life? Like indulgence and luxury?~
@2050 = ~Agreed.~
@2051 = ~I'm not ignoring or dismissing other kind of satisfactions life provides. If anything, I believe your influence refined my tastes, so to speak.~
@2052 = ~So what is the conclusion of this?~
@2053 = ~That single-mindedness is not always the key to success. That some thing should not be sacrificed. I believe I learned some patience.~
@2054 = ~Surprising. Next thing I know, you'll start to develop your hidden appreciation for nature.~
@2055 = ~I appreciate nature because tribe shamans taught me of it's value.~
@2056 = ~Or a sense of humor even.~
@2057 = ~Your tongue is truly a torture for this world. Start moving <CHARNAME>, the day is not getting any younger.~
