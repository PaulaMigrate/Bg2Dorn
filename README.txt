Attached is the file to what the title claims this is: an expansion for the Dorn's romance dialogue for SOA and TOB. There are roughly 26 talks in SOA + 6 talks in TOB (if you count gromnir one), including some interjections for TOB. The expansion adds new talks, expands and modifies existing ones and sometimes changes their order. Starting a new game is STRONGLY recommended, as the romance might not make sense otherwise.

I believe this relatively simple mod addressees what I perceived to be inconsistent progression of the lovetalks and relationship development, as well as brings the content to the same level as the vanilla romances, at least quantity-wise. If you happen to like it, I'm glad, if not, it's ok.

WARNINGS, PLEASE READ-

1. Mod has few limits (such as after- sex dialogue not firing after rest, but just before the next talk) and two tob talks are tied to areas 6000 and 6100.

2. I tried to remain in-character for Dorn, taking into account what we learned from bg1:ee, but I made some modifications to him.
It is still the same character, but with added talks comes a bit more depth and reasons for affection toward CHARNAME. I guess it makes him a bit more tolerant. Take that as you will, it will definitely not be to everyone's taste.

3. I don't remember making any references to gender in new talks but please report if you see anything suspicious in this regard. Regarding Dorn's quest
Spoiler:
it would be best if you make him free of both patrons, otherwise the progression might make no sense. Post gorge quest lovetalk is now always about him being free, since I could not make the variables work for some reason. I apologize for this, but my coding knowledge is limited. You can consider if Dorn has patron, then he has no room for Bhaalspawn.


4. Somewhere in the romance (SOA), there is an alignment change on lawful/chaotic axis. Dorn stays evil! There are no variables implemented because of my coding limits, so try to give Dorn more or less consistent responses for the sake of your roleplay. 

5. I'm not a native english speaker. I tried my best, if anyone is willing to correct the tra files, go ahead. You can also simply report the mistakes if you find them.

6. Additional credits: whiteagnus for cleaning up the code to be more friendly toward original game files. Now the installation won't be so destructive towards original files. Big thanks! Some credits must go to Grim Squeaker, since I took his code from Tyris Flare mod (on G3 site) to make a few interjections for Dorn in Watchers Keep and TOB.

7. Still no bodhi abduction. I can only make it work by borrowing someone else code and that is not an option for a public release. On the other hand the whole quest dedicated to Dorn kind of offsets this, content-wise.

8. Mod works for me (patch 2.0 and above), but it might not work on every other setup and mod combination possible. I take no responsibility for any damage caused to your game, computer, mental health or otherwise if you decide to download, install and play this mod. You have been warned.

9. I would recommend you install ascension mod, or at least shawne's ee epilogues part. Dorn's epilogue there will be much better fit than vanilla one. I tried to make the custom epilogues work for this mod, but no such luck.

This is it, I hope at least someone enjoys this mod :) feel free to give feedback and such, it might help me improve this.
