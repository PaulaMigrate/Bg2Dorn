I'm pleased to announce that Dorn romance expansion has reached version 3.0! I strongly recommend you read this if you intend to install this mod.

This mod is a romance expansion for Dorn, and NPC character added into BG2:EE by Beamdog. This brings content to about 26 talks in SOA and 6 talks in TOB, including some interjections for TOB.
The expansion adds new talks, expands and modifies existing ones and sometimes changes their order. Starting a new game is STRONGLY recommended, as the romance might not make sense otherwise.

I believe this mod addresses what I perceived to be inconsistent progression of the lovetalks and relationship development, as well as brings the content to the same level as the vanilla romances, at least quantity-wise. If you happen to like it, I'm glad, if not, it's ok.

With the GREAT help from EekanImp, text for Dorn expansion has been revised, tenses corrected, articles added/changed, typos corrected.... the list goes on. In any case, the experience as a whole should be much improved!
In case you find errors, please report them!

V3 NEW CONTENT:
With the permission from Aeryn, author of Haer'Dalis Romance over at Spellhold Studious, I used a code and template from her mod to create three additional talks in Underdark. The talks add some content to otherwise empty stretch of the game and are not really romantic but will probably make more sense if you have commited relationship already.

V2 NEW CONTENT:
Bodhi abduction and new/modified epiloges for romanced Dorn. I added some Dorn's unused voiced lines, as well as few voced lines from older games to make talks feel more alive. There were also some corrections and minor changes to dialogues.


INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:

when you download rar file from github (simply click download button when you open link), unrar it and drop "dorn" folder and "setup-dorn.exe" file into installation folder of your BG2:EE game, double click setup-dorn.exe and follow instructions.

PLEASE READ-

1. Install this mod before any other mod that affects Dorn. Thanks to @WhiteAgnus the mod should be safe to use. Post 2.0 patch update of the Infinity games, the mod seems stable.


2. I tried to remain in-character for Dorn, taking into account what we learned from bg1:ee. It is still the same character, but with added talks comes a bit more depth and reasons for affection toward CHARNAME. I guess it makes him a bit more tolerant over time. Take that as you will, it will not be to everyone's taste.

3. The expansion is written for Dorn FREE OF PATRON. Seriously, it will not make sense otherwise.
Consider it like this- if Dorn has a patron, he is effectively slave/bound to someone else. He has no reason to open up to CHARNAME or make any concrete plans for the future, perhaps he might have ulterior motive for romancing you. Thus, the original romance (no bodhi abduction, old epilogues etc.) makes sense and this mod should not be installed.

4. Somewhere in the romance (SOA), there is an alignment shift on chaotic/lawful scale. Dorn stays evil! There are no variables tracks implemented because of my coding limits, so try to give Dorn more or less consistent responses for the sake of your roleplay.

5. If you notice grammar and similar errors, point them out to me please.

6. Some credits must go to Grim Squeaker, since I took his code from Tyris Flare mod (on G3 site) to make a few interjections for Dorn in Watchers Keep and TOB. I also used his code to make bodhi abduction and epilogues work.
Big credit also goes to EekanImp for all the great suggestions and corrections of the text that helped to integrate this mod more seamlessly into the game. Thank you!

7. I take no responsibility for any damage caused to your game, computer, mental health or otherwise if you decide to download, install and play this mod. You have been warned.

Thank you for reading!

3.0- added three new talks in Underdark

2.4- fixed a bug where dorn would try to talk to charname constantly after they arrived in Underdark. It was caused by some old code that pointed to extra talks in underdark, but those were removed. If you had this bug, please reinstall the mod with newest version and if possible restart the game with dorn just before first entering the underdark.

2.3- modified/updated dornj.d file to correct issues with internal labeling that prevented installation of the mod. it seemed to affect people with large amount of mods installed, real culprit was not found atm but the error should be solved
